            "output": "The existence of Chicanx Studies1(CS) programs have been politicized on college campuses in the U.S. Since the 1960s, Chicanx 2students have fought for their own spaces on college campuses, primarily in the form of Chicanx Studies programs that promote representation of Chicanx people in educational curriculum as well as in student and faculty populations. Activism supporting the existence of CS programs has changed the landscape for Chicanx students in college buthas also earned participating students labels such as extreme, racist, and even social justice terrorists (Urrieta, 2004). Politicization ofCS now impactspublic schools in U.S. states such as in Arizona and Texas and, in some cases, hasbeen a catalyst for legal rulings over district bans on textbooks and the courses themselves (Planas, 2017; Planas, 2017). The experiences of being“othered”in educational settings for Chicanx studentsthat serves as precursor for a hostof negative mental health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse among others (Flores, 2013, p. 9). CS programs were originally developed around positivity, with the concept of chicanismobeing about a positive ethnic identity (Urrieta,2004). However, decades ofpoliticization and opposition to CSprograms appears to have obscured many of the original aims and many of the discovered benefits; bothpsychological and social. Background of Chicanx Studies ProgramsEl Plan de Santa Barbarawas first written in 1969 by mostly Chicanx undergraduate and graduate students in California to lay out the formation and expansion of Chicanx Studies in U.S. colleges and universities. Reynaldo Macias, contributor to El Planand a CS professor, recalls some of the original missions behind the document and the expansion of CS as institutional recognition, student visibility, and the voicing of Chicanx aspirations. El Plan was designed to give information and direction to other Chicanx students struggling for the formation of their own CS departments on campus. Macias recalls the impact of El Plan outside Santa Barbara and California, in places such as Texas, where there was much less broad support and momentum for CS. The author of El Plan offered perspective, guidance, CS curricular suggestions, and reports on how CS implementation was unfolding on California college campuses. El Plan help influence the expansion of Chicanx students, faculty, and research on college campuses in the U.S. since the late 1960s (Rangel, 2007).  Authors of El Plan de Santa Barbaraacknowledged the importance of higher learning to the social mobility of Chicanx students and Chicanx communities. The authors conceptualized the institutionalization of CS programs as the just realization of Chicano voice and power on college campuses. This power was defined in terms of self-determination and self-liberation was achieved through control, autonomy, flexibility, and participation. Students and educators behind El Plansaw colleges anduniversities as the primary space for transforming and liberating Chicanx communities. CS programs were described as responsible for educating, researching, and public service to Chicanx communities (Chicano Coordinating Council on Higher Education, 1971).As far as curricular recommendations, the authors of El Plan de Santa Barbarasought to organize the Chicanx experience, in both the past and present. The exploration of heritage is part of the aim to transform the personality and identity of Chicanx students. The purpose of influencing experience and identity is toemphasize the diverse aspects of the Chicanx heritage in the U.S., a heritage that is obscured and hidden for many Chicanx people. The idea is for students to gain understanding of the self, the community, and Chicanx cultural traditions. While the curriculum should be open to all students on campus, according to the authors, the curriculum should be developed specifically for Chicanx students with consideration given to their psychological, social, and intellectual needs. A deficient education system had acted as a barrier to Chicanx social mobility, but the authors felt academic barriers and challenges could be overcome through participation in CS programs that emphasized personal transformation. The authors outlined needed courses in community development, politics and government, Spanish, history of racism and the U.S., culture and art, literature and drama, music, law, and psychology (Chicano Coordinating Council on Higher Education, 1971).Other CS curricular goals included the provision of a coherent and socially-focused education that steers Chicanx students toward a life of service to the Chicanx community but also improves society more broadly. The authors envisioned the development of Chicanx culture to also produce social action and change, resulting in a re-conquest of self and community. All students weresupposed to come away from the CS experience with a new perspective on socio-political change. Chicanx students were meant to develop the ability to influenceinstitutional policy that impactsChicanx individuals and communities. This prowess for political action includes the development of political consciousness into mobilization and honing of specific political tactics (Chicano Coordinating Council on HigherEducation, 1971).In looking at themission statements of current CS programs, the core of El Planappears to remain intact. The CS program at University of California, Berkeley, for example, aims to produce a framework of “an increasingly interconnected world, broadening and deepening, beyond the limited provincialism of Eurocentric perspectives” by taking “seriously the knowledges, epistemologies, and critical thinking produced by racially and sexually oppressed subjects” (Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies,2018, p. 1). The CS department ofCalifornia State University, Los Angeles “offers a dynamic, innovative program that emphasizes an interdisciplinary, comparative, and global approach to understanding the historical experiences and contemporary social status of Mexican-origin populations...inorder to effective pursue social change” (Mission, 2018, p. 1). At the University of California, Santa Barbara, site of the original El Plan, the CS program “seeks to undo colonizing approaches to all areas of life” by “reinventing into new combinationsthe liberatory aspects of cultures, languages, politics, and economies”(What does Chicana/o mean?, 2018, p. 1).Issues Facing Chicanx Students in the AcademyAs El Plan de Santa Barbaraacknowledged in 1969,Chicanx students face psychological, social, and academic challenges on college campuses in the U.S. Experiences of discrimination are a common psychological experience for Latinx and Chicanx students (Cokely et al, 2017). These experiencesof discrimination often result in barriers to academic achievement in college (Ong, Phinney, & Dennis, 2006), and earlier (Martinez, DeGarmo, & Eddy, 2004). Latinx college students report experiences of depressive symptoms associated with their experiences of discrimination (Brittian et al, 2015). Latinx students also report increased alcohol use and trauma-related symptoms (Cheng & Mallinckrodt, 2015). For Chicanx students, experiences of discrimination are negatively correlated with subjective well-being(Villegas-Gold& Chol Yoo,2014). One common pattern of response includes disengagement characterized by social withdrawal, self-criticism, and problem avoidance. Chicanx college students also experience high levels of acculturative stress, which results in higher levels of anxietyand depressive symptomology (Crockett et al., 2007). In addition to discrimination, class status and economic challenges are also shown to impact academic achievement (Caldas & Bankston, 1997). Latinx and Chicanx students who experience psychological distress report that these experiences impact their academic performance and are linked to higher rates of dropout (Alva & de los Reyes, 1999). Latinx college students have also been found to experience significantly higher levels of psychological distress related to academic, financial, andpersonal concerns than their white peers (Quintana, Vogel, & Ibarra, 1991). Chicanx students are among the lowest achieving students according to demographics in undergraduate education (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004),and this problem is exacerbated by the fact the Chicanx people compose the largest Latinx subgroup and is the largest growing Latinx community in the U.S. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010). When compared to all other Latinx ethnic subgroups, Chicanx studentsare among the lowest achieving in academics(Chapa & De La Rosa, 2004). One problem plaguing Chicanx student achievement and degree attainment is student rentention (Gándara & Contreras, 2009; Urbina & Wright, 2015). While U.S. colleges anduniversities fail to adequately address these low levels of academic achievement and degree attainment, resources and spaces aimed at addressing these outcomes must be identified. Gains Associated with Chicanx StudiesChicanx Studies programs, to some extent, are capable of, and have previously addressed these negative outcomes from Chicanx students. Among the many gains associated with CS programs, there are several psychological outcomes that stand out. For example, the development of critical consciousness has been shown to be important to the career commitment for urban youth (Diemer & Blustein, 2006) and intent to persist through college for both citizen and undocumented Latinx students (Cadenas, Bernstein, & Tracey, 2018). Critical consciousness and critical frameworks are an important feature of CS programs (Acosta, 2007; Delgado Bernal, 2002; Valenzuela, 1999; Camarotta, 2014), and some authors have noted the value of critical consciousness in all educational systems, not just CS programs (Yosso, 2002). Positive ethnic identity is another psychological gain associated with CS programs (Urrieta, 2004; Carbrera, Meza, Romero, & Rodriguez, 2013; O’Leary & Romero, 2011). Positive ethnic identity has been associated with higher levels of academic achievement for Latinxand Chicanxstudents (Ong, Phinney, & Dennis,2006), while a negative ethnic identity attitude has been associated with lower levels of achievement and retention (Gándara & Contreras, 2009). For some Chicanx students, a positive ethnic identity serves as a protectivefactor (Iturbide, Raffaeli, & Carlo, 2009). A sense of belonging is also linked to CS participation, and a lack of belonging was reported as a barrier by Latinx college students (Hernandez, 2002). Erosion of a sense of belonging for Chicanx people has made them more vulnerable to mental disorders and emotional distress (Flores, 2013). For Latinx college students, a sense of belonging facilitatespositive psychological adjustment to the college environment (Nunez, 2009). Chicanx students’ social class position impacts their sense of belonging in college (Schwartz, Donovan & Guido-Brito, 2009), but conveying a sense of belonging to other students and future generations has the impact of fostering broader belonging (Benmayor, 2002).CS programs and courses promote a sense of belonging for participating students (Cabrera, Meza, Romero, & Rodriguez, 2013; Espinoza-Gonzalez et al., 2013; O’Leary & Romero, 2011; Valenzuela, 1999; Vasquez, 2005). Ethnic studies programs in general have been shown to foster increased agency and motivation (Sleeter, 2001), and participation in CShas been shown to increase graduation rates as well ashigh passing rates on the comprehensive state exam (Cabrera, Milem, Jaquette, & Marx, 2014). Similarly, it has been found tofacilitate cognitive growth (Acosta, 2007;Dee & Penner, 2016). While psychological distress and mental health challenges are specific issues for Latinx and Chicanx college students, the gains associated with and facilitated by social justice activism also appear toplay an important role in addressing those specific mental health concerns. Social justice activism appears in some ways to address the psychological issues facing Latinx and Chicanx students in the U.S, also acting as a protective factor (Hope et al, 2018). Activism also appears to play a large psychological role in ethnic studies programs (Acosta, 2013), increasing participating students’ hope, reducing risky behaviors, and helping some students replace their aggression in responseto oppression with more positive and constructive approaches (Ginwright & Camarotta, 2007).Current StudyThis dissertation study was meant to explorethe phenomena ofparticipating in CS training, which includes,but is not limited to,academic courses,campus and social organizations, and activism. Research exists around the history, mission, and struggle for broader inclusion of gender-oppressed people associated with CS, but researchers have yet to understand the phenomena of positive psychological and academic functioning that appears to come along with CS. In fact, very little is even known about how students describe their own experiences in CS. Exploration of how students are describing their experience and any gains must first be considered beforeany formalization or modeling of results can occur.Qualitative methodologies are consistent with exploration of constructs, experiences, and phenomena in their natural settings, while maintaining consideration of the participants themselves and their environments (Creswell & Poth, 2018). This dissertation study draws upon qualitative methodologies to seek the Chicanx college student perspective on what CS means to them through semi-structured interviews, taking into account participants’current campus environment. Maintainingthe integrity of the participant words is a focus of this study because one of the aims to understand the phenomena of majoring in CS from the perspective of the students themselves. The results of student interviews will be considered in terms of changesto higher academic institutions.Within the qualitative paradigm, the specific approach of transcendental phenomenology was employed in this dissertation study.Transcendental phenomenology attempts to describe the essence of phenomena through examining the textural and structural dimensions, or more simply, the “what” and “how” of a phenomenon, through a process called horizonalization (Moustakas, 1994). Centralto this proposed study will be understanding the voices of participants as they highlight the“essence” of experiencing CS as amajor. By emphasizing what students describe as their experience, an analysis of structural and contextual factors in those experiences follows.Research QuestionsThe dissertation study explored the following research questions related to participation in CS:  1.How do undergraduate students describe the psychological process of Chicanx Studies training?2.How have students been impacted by their participation in CS?3.What contextual and structuralfactors facilitated these impacts?"

            "output": " The effective recruitment and retention of ethnically and racially minoritized people has been a long-standing challenge within the field of school psychology (Esquivelet al., 2007). The challenges with recruiting students from underrepresented backgrounds has contributed to a severe lack of representation among school psychologists that is not reflective of theethnically, racially, and linguistically diverse children and families receiving services today (National Associationof School Psychologists, 2009). Despite over 50% of students in U.S. schools being from historically marginalized backgrounds, under 15% of school psychologist are from historically marginalized backgrounds (Goforth et al., 2021). Although the number of raciallyand ethnicallyprofessionals in school psychology has increased over the years, it remains“persistently low” (Fagan, 2004, p. 427).Prior to 1990, non-White school psychologists represented less than 6% of school psychologists (Curtis et al., 1999). From 1990 to 2015, the percentage of minoritized school psychologists only increased from 6% to 7% (Goforth et al. 2021; Castillo et al., 2014). However, by the year 2050, it is expected that 62% of youth will be children of color (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).Therefore, thereis a critical need to increase the number of school psychologists of color in the field to serve youth of color and their families. This starts with addressing the underrepresentation of graduate students of color in school psychology programs. This dissertation study aims to examine self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, hope, and belongingness among Black students who are currently enrolled in graduate school psychology programsto further inform efforts to recruit and retain Black school psychology graduate students.This dissertation study also aims to explore the degree to which the school psychology training domains as set forth by the National Association of School Psychology (NASP) align with Black students’ perceived task value in their role as aspiring school psychologistswith the ultimate goal of further aligning the profession in ways to enhance recruitment and retention efforts.Rationale for the StudyAs the number of school psychologists from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds are among the lowest and slowest changing characteristics in comparison to other branches of psychology (Curtis et al., 2012; Goforth et al., 2016; Fagan, 2004; Proctor et al., 2014), it is critical to expand the literature base that raises awareness of this issue. Recently observed demographics highlight the underrepresentation of both practitioners and faculty from ethnically and racially backgrounds withinthe school psychology workforce, which ispredominantly White and female (Walcott & Hyson, 2018).The most recent American Psychological Association Center for Workforce Study foundthat ethnically and racially minoritizedindividuals comprised 26.4% and 16.7% of full-time faculty in counseling and clinical psychology programs, respectively, whereas there were only 11.8% in school psychology programs (Curtis et al., 2012). When considering the role of school psychologists as key providers of educational and mental health services for increasingly diverse youth, there are compelling advantages to diversifying the workforce. Blake et al. (2016) explained that “having a diverse workforce in school psychology...offers educational benefits to psychologists in training and society as a whole in terms of improving the quality of culturally sensitive mental health service delivery made available to children from disenfranchised groups” (p. 307). Further, Chandler (2011) stated that theshortage of school psychologists from historically underrepresented backgrounds –particularly African American faculty –is a “public health concern” due to the increasing demand to provide quality mental health services to diverse populations (p. 104). In regard to training, research indicates that diversity in communities of higher education broadensstudents’ perception of diversity and promotespositive learning outcomes (Chang, 2002; Pike et al., 2007). Further, students who are enrolled in graduateprograms with people from different cultural backgrounds gain a better understanding of the unique experiences of others,which heightenstheir level of cultural awareness(Newell et al. 2010). Therefore, increasing the number of students from historically marginalized backgrounds in school psychology programs could contribute to a more profound and purposeful experience for school psychology trainees who may potentially become the faculty in school psychology programs. The school psychology studentsfrom ethnically and racially minoritized backgrounds may alsobecome the service providers for diverse youth and families. School psychologists play a key role in providing educational and mental health services to all youth (NASP, 2021; Chandler, 2011). Training in culturally sensitive practices helpsschool psychologistsprovide more effective services to minoritized youth (Jones, 2014). However, there is also value in increasing the accessibility of service providers whoare racially, ethnically, culturally, and linguistically similar to the students being served. A growing body of literature on the potential benefits of racialethnic match and greaterdiversity ofschool-based service providers indicatesthat having a racialethnic match is associated withfewerbehavior problems among youth (Downer et al., 2016);enriched therapeutic relationships (Bernal et al., 2009; Cabral & Smith, 2011);and increased parent participation in prevention trainings (Bates & Glick, 2013). These potential benefits suggest that effective recruitment of school psychologists from underrepresented backgrounds can cultivate a profession that better serves students and their families. The experiences, knowledge, understanding, and worldviews of school psychologists from diverse populations can improve overall “sensitivity, awareness to advocate for, conduct research relevant to, and effectively provide mental health services to children from racial and ethnic minority communities” (Blake et al., 2016, p. 306). This study will specifically focus on considerations for recruiting and retainingBlackschool psychologistsin the field. Importance of the TopicIt is important that the views of Black individuals within school psychology be given more attention throughresearch,especially as it pertains to diversifying the profession. There is a troublesome history of the use of discriminatory assessments, evaluations, and practices that raise concern about the experiences of Black students in the U.S. education system. One example is the Larry P. v. Rilescase that was filed successfully against the state of California in the late 1970’s. The case ensued that the administration of culturally biased standardized intelligencetests(e.g., intellectual quotient tests or IQ tests)resulted in disproportionatenumbers of African American children being identified and inappropriately placed in special education classesfor the educable mentally retarded(EMR)1(Larry P. v. Riles, 1979). More recently, research indicates that Black students continue to be disproportionately categorized with Emotional Disturbance (Aud et al., 2010; Bal et al., 2019; Sullivan & Bal, 2013), and are subjected to segregated special education placements and harsher disciplinary action in schools (Fisher et al., 2020; Skiba et al., 2006; Skiba et al., 2014). Considering that Black students represent 16% of the student population yetcomprise32-42% of the students who faculty are just as uninformed about school psychology as the students. Among the small sample of faculty members who participated, 78% expressed that organizations such as NASP and Division 16 of APAneglected to provide information about school psychology to HBCUs (Graves& Wright, 2009). Also, 64% of the faculty from the HBCU’s who completed the survey reported that there is no active recruitment from school psychology programs and these faculty also believe that there are limited opportunities for Black students in school psychology compared to other subfields of psychology (Graves & Wright, 2009). The disconnect expressed by leaders of the HBCU community toward the field of school psychology is concerning, especially if they do not perceive school psychology as a viable career choice for the students on their campus who are primarily Black. Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine the experiences of Black graduate school psychology students who havechosen to pursue the field as it may have implications for future recruitment efforts. Limited school psychology faculty. The percentage of counseling and clinical psychologists in faculty positions are 17% and 14%, respectively (APA, 2019). Based on data acquired from NASP, under eight percent of school psychologists are employed in university settings while over 80% are employed in school settings (Walcott & Hyson, 2018). However, as school psychology faculty continue to retire and few graduate studentsreport a desire to pursue academic positions, shortages of school psychologists are projected to increase over the next decade (Goforth et al., 2020; Castillo et al., 2014; Clopton & Haselhun, 2009). More specifically, it is predicted that there will be 1,055 unfilled school psychologist positions by 2025 (Castillo et al., 2014). Additionally, only 20% of school psychology programs report having a graduating class of, at minimum, ten students (AAEE, 2020). With there being too few school psychology programs to meet the growing demand for school psychologists, a trickle-down effect is observed. Given that graduate-level courses tend to be smaller, even if more students were recruited, there may not be enough faculty to accommodate more students. Consequently, there remains a lownumberof school psychology faculty that are homogenous in terms of ethnic background, especially given the lack of recruitment from minority-serving institutions such as HBCUs (Graves & Wright, 2009). Thus, continued lack of school psychology faculty plays an integral role in minimizing undergraduate students’ exposure to the field, which contributes to the underrepresentation of Black school psychology faculty. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (2020), 4% of full-time professors and 5% of full-time assistant professors are Black. Also, only 5% of school psychology faculty are Black (Walcott et al., 2018). Moreover, data from NASP indicate that only 3% its members identify as Black or African American (Walcott et al., 2018). However, in a study where researchers aimed to explore the roles and practices of school psychologists working in urban schools, 30% of participants identified as Black or African American(Graves et al., 2014). These notable demographic differences may imply that there are career preferences among Black school psychologistsand that a substantial number of Black or African American school psychologist may not be affiliated with NASP. Truscott et al. (2014) found that Black school psychologists perceived their fundamental roles as advocating for youth of color and being positive representations of people of color. As a result, they may be more likely to seek employment as practitioners to work more closely and deliberately with youth of color than to pursue academia. There may also be challenges associated with availability, access, and perceived value of pursuing a doctorate, which is the requisite entry-level degree for academia, whereas a master’s or specialist degree is sufficient for practice.Social and economic factors. Racial and ethnic disparities in the context of education have been consistently observed and evidenced over centuries (Albee, 1969; Aud et al., 2010; Bal et al., 2019; Sullivan & Bal, 2013). According to APA (2012), educational disparities (or more appropriately, limited opportunities in education), result from differences in social class, biased treatment, and the varied responses to adverse experiences that disproportionately impact racial and ethnic youth. Some of the indicators of social class documented in education include parental socioeconomic status, school demographics, and neighborhood demographics (Aud et al., 2010). Therefore, it could be deduced that lack of equity in education directly affect students of color in terms of limiting their access and exposure to quality educational resources and opportunities (Edyburn et al., 2021). Given that systemic inequities contribute to a lower quality of education, lack of educational opportunity, and lack of employment opportunity (Quintana & Mahgoub, 2016, p. 96), these issues should be considered in the recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented backgrounds.The U.S. Department of Education (2020) indicates that the average cost to attendgraduate school is about $10,000 for in-state students and $30,000 for out-of-state students. The average income for Black families is the lowest at$44,000 compared to the $56,000 for Latino/Hispanic families, $76,000 for White families, and $98,000 for Asian families (U.S. Bureau Labor of Statistics, 2020); this could serve as a barrier to attending graduate school. Black students from low-income families are twice as likely to have education debt due to borrowing loans to pay for graduate school (Grinstein-Weiss et al., 2016). Considering that the median salary of school psychologists is $74,000 (Goforth et al., 2021), Black students may elect to go into careers where they might expect more pay in entry-level positions such as medical, science, technology, engineering, mathematics or even business (Ruder & Van Noy, 2018), to ensure they can repay student loans. Given these looming barriers, it may be difficult for Black students to consider school psychology as a viable career option without proper funding support to be successfully complete their program. Microaggressionsand bias. Before Black and Brown students ever think about attending college, they may face disparate treatment in school. For example, in a meta-analysisby Tennebaum and Ruck (2007), teachers were found to hold higher academic expectationsfor Asian American and White students than Black and Latino students. They were also found to be more supportive and encouraging toward Asian American and White students than Black and Latino students. However, educator bias toward student capabilities ofsuccess based on race and ethnicity is also prominent at the university-level. Lott and Rogers (2011) engaged in a study evaluating the beliefs and experiences of White and ethnically, racially diverseundergraduate psychology majors and they found that although both groups reported similar reasons for selecting psychology as a major, their perceived challenges were different. Students from historically marginalized backgroundswere significantly more likely to report their challenges as being a lack of encouragement or respect from professors and finding inaccurate representations of their ethnic group in textbooks and lectures (Lott & Rogers, 2011). Microaggressions are defined as “brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to people of color because they belong to a racial minority group” (Sue et al., 2007, p. 273).  With microaggressions being a real and pervasive problem experienced among graduate students of color (Sue et al., 2007; Sue, 2010), the success or retention of Black students in school psychology programs are of concern. For example, Clark et al. (2012) found negative race-related experiences, lower perceptions of belongingness, and lower perceptions of autonomy to be barriers to underrepresented student’s pursuits in graduate school psychology programs. Proctor and Truscott (2012) also found that Black students who exited their school psychology programs reported cultural incongruity, misalignment with professional goals, and negative relations with faculty. Unfortunately, these findings underscore the educational disparities, which act as a microcosm of the systemic and institutional racism that Black and Brown people are forced to endure. Therefore, efforts to progress thefield must be intentionalin challengingthe existingsystemsand ideologies.Motivating Factors of Ethnically and Racially Minoritized Studentsto Pursue School PsychologyIn addition to considering barriers that may impact Black students desire to attend school psychologygraduate programs, it is alsoimportant to highlight potential motivating factors to pursuing an advanced degree in school psychology. Despite there being a dearth of literature regarding the motivations for graduate students’ pursuits of careers in school psychology, one of the studies found that the desire to work with children was one of the more common reasons endorsed (Graves & Wright, 2007). Using a mixed-methodological approach, the researchers surveyed 307 school psychology graduate students about their goals in obtaining a degree in school psychology. Based on a Likert scale, the graduate students rated the various aspects of school psychology that impacted their decision to receive an advanced degree in the field. The qualitative part of the studyalso asked participants open-ended questions pertaining to their reasons for applying to school psychology training programs. The results showed that 92% of the respondents indicated that “working with children” was important or very important in their decision to pursue school psychology. Similarly, the open-ended questions yielded a majority of responses indicating that working with children greatly influenced their decision to apply to school psychology graduate programs. Other studies in whichthe reasons for wanting to work as a school psychologist were assessed further demonstrated that many individuals in the field enjoy helping students, individually and collectively (Graces & Wright, 2007). However, the demographics of students included in the studies are unknown. As a result,much less is known about motivating factors for Black students to pursue school psychology.The challenges for Black students that were previously discussed include a lack of exposure to the field of school psychology, concerns regarding socioeconomic factors, and microaggressions. It is possible that, if some of these barriers were addressed, Black students might be further motivated to pursue school psychology. For example, bridge or pathway programs have been designed by some colleges and universities to expand the pool of successful applicants to specific programs(Pham et al., 2021). Many of the bridge programs focus primarily on diversifying that field of study.Therefore, the creation of a bridge program that provides early and increased exposure of Black undergraduates to school psychology could be a means of motivating them to pursue graduate training programs. As an exemplar, Florida International University, which is a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI),actively recruits over 75% of students from historically marginalized backgroundsinto their school psychology program despite their students reporting being unfamiliar with school psychology in their undergraduate studies (Pham et al., 2021). In regard to socioeconomic factors, increased opportunities for teaching assistantships, departmental grants, or paid practicum experiences could help alleviate some of these financial stressors (Washington et al., 2020). However, the inclusion of social justice and advocacy on behalf of the Black community have been found to beanimportantconsideration among Black graduate students (Miranda et al., 2014; Truscott et al., 2014). Thus, providinginformation and opportunities forBlack students to learn ways they might be able to improve the lives of youth and families in their communities can be strong motivating factors. Yet, because much less is known about the reasons that Black students choose careers in school psychology, this study aims to fill this gap. Through investigating the socio-cognitive factors and alignment of Black students’ perception of NASP domains, this study will expand the literature seeking to improve the recruitment and retention of Black students in school psychology graduate training programs. Major Research Questions and HypothesesThe major aim of this dissertation study is to better understand perceived experiences of Black graduate school psychology students. The overall goal is to better understand the social and cognitive factors that are related to Black graduate students’ perception of their academic pursuits in school psychology. Specifically, this study will explore self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, hope, and belonginess in Black graduate school psychology students to better understand how to improve recruitment strategies for Black school psychologists. Thesesocio-cognitivefactors will be examined for their ability to predict career satisfaction and will also provide a critical lens for evaluating the unique barriers faced by Black students in the field.  Prior research indicates that there exists a correlation betweenself-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value and career satisfaction (Lent et al., 1994). Belongingness has also been found to have a positive correlation with self-efficacy (Goodneow & Grady,1993). However, theeffect of hope and belongingness onself-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task valuehave not been explored. Comparatively, the evaluation of Black graduate school psychology students’ perceived alignment with NASP training domains hasnot been directly explored and can provide valuable information about how to improve retention. Therefore, it is useful to use the NASP training domains as a measure of whether Blackgraduate school psychologystudents perceive the field’s goals align with their own professional goals. The specific research questions and hypotheses of this study are: RQ1:Are self-efficacy, outcome expectations,task value, hope, and belongingnesssignificant predictors of Black graduateschool psychology students’careerchoice satisfaction?H1:Self-efficacy, outcome expectations,task value, hope, and belongingnessare significant predictors of Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction. H0:Self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, hope and belongingnessare not significant predictors of Black graduateschool psychologystudents’ career choice satisfaction.RQ2:Do hope and belonginess mediatethe relation between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, and Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction?H2:Hope and belongingness mediatethe relation between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, and Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction. H0:Hope and belongingness do not mediatethe relation between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, and Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction."

We  evaluated these  questions acrossthree  studies  incorporating  children fromthe  University  of  California, Davis  MIND  Institute’s  Autism  Phenome  Project  and  Girls  with  Autism  imaging  of Neurodevelopment cohorts. Autism symptoms and severity level were evaluated using the ADOS Calibrated Severity Score (CSS). Around half (46%-51%) of the children in the cohort changed in symptom severity levelover  time,  with  the  other  half  remaining  stable. Change  in  symptom severity  was  not  consistent  but  rather  fluctuated  over  time;severity  decreases  were  more common  during  early  childhoodwhileseverity  increases  occurred atboth early  and  middle childhood.Most children experienced change during only one period and remained stable during the other.Social-communication challenges and restricted/repetitive behaviors(RRBs) changeddifferentlyacross   childhood. During   middle   childhood,increase   in social-communication symptomswas especially prominentin parallel toRRBs severity decrease. Being female, having higherand increasingIQ, higher adaptive functioning,and havingolder, more educated parents wereassociated with decrease in symptom severity. Decreasing RRBs severity during middle childhood was associated with higher anxiety and probability forhaving an anxiety disorder at 11yearsof age. Increasing symptom severity was associated with having lower and stable IQ, lower adaptive functioning and not making peer-equivalent gains over time, lower parental education level and younger parental age at the child’s birth.Increasing severity of social-communication challengesduring middle childhood was associated with elevatedand increasing anxiety, ADHD, disruptive behavior problems and overall psychopathology.Symptom severity change patterns were not associated witheither initial severity level at 3-years-of-age orinterventionhistory.

            "output": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting 1 out of every 44 children in the US today (Maenner  et  al.,  2021).  Autism  is  behaviorally  defined by the  presence  of  two  core  symptom domains: social-communicationchallenges  and  restricted/repetitive  patterns  of  behaviors  and interests  (RRBs) (APA,  2013).  In  order  to  receive  a  diagnosis  of  autism,  an  individual  must sufficiently exhibit symptoms from both these groups (APA, 2013). The  first  domain, social-communicationchallenges,  comprises  different  aspects of  social interaction including socio-emotional reciprocity, use of non-verbal communication methods and forming  and  maintaining  relationships.  Impairment  must  be  evident  in  each  of  these  areas  in order  to  receive  a  diagnosis  of  autism.  The  second  domain,  RRBs,  refers  to  several  types  of behaviors  including  stereotypical  movements  and  object  use,  insistence  on  sameness,  highly-focused areas of interest and sensory hypo/hyper reactivity. Autism  symptoms  present  differently  within  different  individuals.  Specifically,  they  rangewidelyin their severity level, i.e., in how impactful they are on the person’s everyday behavior. Some  individuals  experience  substantial social-communicationdifficulties  and/or  many  and severe forms of RRBs. For others, however, these symptoms are less apparent and less restricting in their everyday interactions and life. In order to help clinicians evaluate the presence of core symptoms in an individual’s behavior, standardized assessment measures have been developed (Waizbard-Bartov  &  Miller,  2023).  These  tools  provide  a  standardized  measure  for  assessing autism  symptoms,  based  on  predetermined  thresholds  for  symptom  severity  levels  that  likely meet criteria to receive an autism diagnosis (Yu, Ozonoff, & Miller, 2023). One such tool is the Autism  Diagnostic  Observation  Schedule (Lord  et  al.,  2000;  C.    Lord  et  al.,  2012),  or  ADOS, considered the gold standard assessment measure for direct observation of autism symptoms. The  ADOS  is  a  semi-structured  social  interaction  that  creates  opportunities  for the  assessor to evaluate the presence of core symptoms in the individual’sbehavior. Itincludes five  modules, each adapted forindividuals of a specific age and language ability, from Pre-Verbal/Single wordsup  to Fluent  Speech. The  ADOS  produces both raw  scores  for  symptom  levels  as  well  as standardized comparison scores (the Calibrated Severity Scores; CSS)(Gotham, Pickles, & Lord, 2009).  The  CSS  range  from  1  (least  severe)  to  10  (most  severe)  and  are  used  to  quantify  the severity  level  of  core  symptoms  as evident  in  the  assessment.  In  addition to the total  CSS,  the ADOS also produces standardized scores to evaluate social-communicationchallenges (SA CSS) and  RRBs  (RRB  CSS),  separately (Hus,  Gotham,  &  Lord,  2014).  Because  these  are  standardized scores,  they  enable  comparison  of  symptom  severity  levels  between  different  individuals  and within specific individuals over time. Longitudinal  studies  have  used  the  ADOS  CSS  repeatedly  across  measurements  to  try  and understand if autism core symptoms remain stable, or rather change, across the life span. Many studies have indicated that autism symptoms tend to remain stable over time, identifying very large groups of individuals, between 80%-90% across samples, that remain stable in the severity of their core symptoms over time (Gotham, Pickles, & Lord, 2012; Venker, Ray-Subramanian, Bolt, & Ellis Weismer, 2014). Other studies, however, have emphasized change in symptom severity. For instance, Fountain, Winter, and Bearman (2012)found that, in a very large sample (N=6975), most children showed significant change in symptom severity from age 3 to 14. While this study did  not  utilize  standardized  assessment  tools  for  autism  symptoms  (but  rather  a  parent interview), it has the power of having a very large sample size. Another longitudinal study using the   Autism   Diagnostic   Interview-Revised   (ADI-R), (Lord,   Rutter,   &   Le   Couteur,   1994),   a standardized parent  interviewfor  autism  symptoms,  found  that  symptoms  tended  to  either change or remain stable in severity across time, to almost equal proportions across individuals in their  sample (Shattuck  et  al.,  2007).  For  participants  who  did  experience  change  (46%), decreasing severity (26%) was more common than increasing severity (20%), yet both types of change  occurred  within  the  sample.  Collectively,these  studies  indicate  that  some  individuals change  in the  severity  of their  core  symptoms  over time,  to either  increase  or decrease, while others  remain  stable,  and  it  is  not  clear  what  proportions  of  individuals  experience  change compared to symptom stability.   To further complicate things, studies identifying change in symptom severity have shown that it is not consistent within individuals overtime. Severity change can differ in:(a) when it occurs during  development  (periods  of  stability  compared  to  periods  of  change  within anindividual) (Georgiades et al., 2021); (b)the direction of change (decreasing compared to increasing severity) (Clark,   Barbaro,   &   Dissanayake,   2017); and (c) the   rate   at   which  change   occurs   (e.g., fast/moderate change, consistent pace/slowing with time) (Georgiades, Bishop, & Frazier, 2017; Taylor & Seltzer, 2010). Thus, symptom severity change may manifest differently across various developmental periods. Changein  autism  symptoms  is  also  characterized  by  differences  between  the  two  core domains  comprising  it (Fountain  et  al.,  2012).  Evidence  suggests that social-communicationchallenges tend  todecrease  in  severity  with  age (Bal,  Kim,  Fok,  &  Lord,  2019;  Fountain  et  al., 2012; Lord, Bishop, & Anderson, 2015), while RRBs have been found to either decrease (Shattuck et al., 2007), increase (Lord et al., 2015)or remain stable over time (Gillespie-Lynch et al., 2012). This difference in the tendency for severity change, as well as which type of change occurs, can impact  our  ability to understand  change  in the severity  of  overall  autism  symptoms  (using the ADOS total symptom severity score), as well as separately foreachdomain. The  three  types  of  differences  described  above  (between-person,  within-person-over-time and  across-symptom-domains)  make  change  in  autism  symptom  severity  extremely  variable (Georgiades et al., 2017). Moreover, at the individual level, these differences make it very hard to try and predict if and how a person’score symptom severity will change overtime. Yet, there may  be  additional  factors  that  can  assist  when  attempting  to  make  such  a  prediction. Autistic individualsoftenface other,  co-occurring  challenges inaddition  to  those  brought  on  by  core symptoms (Mutluer   et   al.,   2022).   These   includeneurodevelopmental   and mental  health challengessuch as  ADHD, anxiety, aggressive behaviors and depression (Lai et al., 2019; Simonoff et  al.,  2008),intellectual  disability(Maenner  et  al.,  2021;  Solomon  et  al.,  2018),  languagedisorders (Schaeffer et al., 2023), sleep problems (Chen et al., 2021), gastrointestinal symptoms(Reynolds  et  al.,  2021),  epilepsy (Karunakaran  et  al.,  2020)and  others.  Thehigh  prevalence  of suchcomorbidities among autistic individuals suggest that they are a fundamental part of how havingautism impacts a person’s everyday life (Waizbard-Bartov, Fein, Lord, & Amaral, 2023a). In  addition,  these  co-occurring  challenges  as  well  as  other  developmental  and  environmental factors also interact with and influence change in core symptom levels throughout the life span.  For  instance,  being  a  girl  has  been  associated  with  a  stronger  tendency  to  decrease  in  the severity of core symptoms during early childhood compared to being a boy (Szatmari et al., 2015). Decreasing in autism symptom severity has also been linked with having average-range IQ;i.e., not havingintellectual disability (Fein et al., 2013; Georgiades et al., 2021; Gotham et al., 2012; Woodman, Smith, Greenberg, & Mailick, 2015). In contrast, toddlers with developmental delays as well as preschool-aged children who are minimally verbal or have speech delays are less likely to  decrease  in  core  symptom  severity,  especially in  the  domain  ofsocial-communication challenges (Bal et al., 2019; Hinnebusch, Miller, & Fein, 2017). Adaptive functioning has also been associated  with  change  in  core  symptom  severity (Charman  et  al.,  2011;  Gotham  et  al.,  2012; Perry, Flanagan, Dunn Geier, & Freeman, 2009), though not consistently (Kim, Macari, Koller, & Chawarska,  2016;  Szatmari  et  al.,  2015),  making  this  potential  relationship  a  target  for  further investigation. Co-occurring mental health challenges may also impact change in core symptom severity.  Dealing  with  comorbidities  such  as  anxiety  has  been  associated  with  increasing symptom severity (Baribeau et al., 2022), while decreasing levels of mental health problemsis associated  with  marked  decreases  in  core  symptom  levels(Orinstein  et  al.,  2015).  Finally,  the literature shows individuals’ initial symptom severity levels at the time of diagnosis is not necessarily a good predictor of future change in core symptom levels (Bal et al., 2019; Pellicano, Cribb, & Kenny, 2019; Sutera et al., 2007). Environmental  factors  have also been  linked  with  change  in  core  symptom  levels  during childhood. Sociodemographic factors may impact children’s change, and especially the tendency for severity increase. Living in an impoverished neighborhood (Simonoff et al., 2019), having less educated parents,and coming from lower socioeconomic status (Fountain et al., 2012)have all been  associated  with  increasing  symptom  severity  or  with  having  a  lower  likelihood  for decreasing  severity (Fountain  et  al.,  2012;  Georgiades  et  al.,  2021). It  is  unclear  whether children’s intervention history is associated with their symptom severity trajectories. While early intervention   has   been   established   as beneficialfor   young   children   on   the   spectrum (Zwaigenbaum  et  al.,  2015),  some  studies  have  found  no  relationship  between  intervention history and severity change (Giserman-Kiss & Carter, 2019; Gotham et al., 2012). Evaluating the literatureto date, is not clear how common change in the severity of autism symptoms over timeis. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that once change does occur, it is not linear in nature but rather can differ across development. We still do notyetunderstand, however,what  characterizes  different  developmental  periods  in  relation  to varioustypes  of severity  change.  The  literature  consistently  shows  that  the  two  symptom  domains, social-communicationchallenges  and  RRBs,  have  different  developmental trajectories over time. Buthow  they  change  in  relation  to  each  other  and their  differentialimpactonthe  total  autism symptom trajectory ofan individualare not clear. Finally, both developmental and environmental factorsimpact individuals’ core symptom trajectories over time, making it crucial to understand what defineschildren who  either  increase,  decrease  or  remain  stable  in  their  symptom  levels. Understanding thecharacteristics of thechildrenwhose symptoms change over timeis important to  our  understanding both of  longitudinal  trajectories in  autism and  how trajectoriesimpact outcomes. This understanding can help us to better provide supports that promotedecreases in core symptom levels andprevent potential increasesover time,and to identify those who are at risk for other challenges (e.g., mental health) allowing for earlier intervention for these difficulties as well. In the following set of studies, I evaluated change in the severity of core symptoms for the children of the University of California, Davis MIND Institute’s Autism Phenome Project (APP) and Girls with Autism Imaging of Neurodevelopment (GAIN) studies. I sought to answer the following fourquestions: 1.Do the core symptoms of autism change in severity over time? And if so, how common is change? 2.Does symptom severity change differ between periods of development? How is change characterized over time? 3.Does change in symptom severity differ between the two core domains? How do these impact change in total autism symptom severity level? 4.What developmental and environmental factors characterize children that either increase or decrease in symptom severity across childhood?"

Change  in  symptom severity  was  not  consistent  but  rather  fluctuated  over  time;severity  decreases  were  more common  during  early  childhoodwhileseverity  increases  occurred atboth early  and  middle childhood.Most children experienced change during only one period and remained stable during the other.Social-communication challenges and restricted/repetitive behaviors(RRBs) changeddifferentlyacross   childhood. During   middle   childhood,increase   in social-communication symptomswas especially prominentin parallel toRRBs severity decrease. Being female, having higherand increasingIQ, higher adaptive functioning,and havingolder, more educated parents wereassociated with decrease in symptom severity. Decreasing RRBs severity during middle childhood was associated with higher anxiety and probability forhaving an anxiety disorder at 11yearsof age. Increasing symptom severity was associated with having lower and stable IQ, lower adaptive functioning and not making peer-equivalent gains over time, lower parental education level and younger parental age at the child’s birth.Increasing severity of social-communication challengesduring middle childhood was associated with elevatedand increasing anxiety, ADHD, disruptive behavior problems and overall psychopathology.Symptom severity change patterns were not associated witheither initial severity level at 3-years-of-age orinterventionhistory.

            "output": "ParticipantsSeven undergraduate students, who had previously taken at least one Chicanx Studies course and intended totakeat least one additional course during the academic period of the initial interview, participated in this study. This experiential criterion of requiring students to have taken CS courses and taking another during the period of participation in this proposed study was createdto preserve adeep and fresh understanding of the phenomenon (Moustakas, 1994). While being a CS major was not a requirement of participation, all participants ended up being CS majors. Other participant criteria included students indicatingthat CS has had a significant impact on their educational journey thus far, beingChicanx-identified,and at least 18-years-old.Recruitment began with emails requesting participation in a study about experiences as a Chicanx Studies student. Requests were sent from an undergraduate listserv in a CS department at a west coast university. This email included information about the study, how to participate, incentives offered, and rights of the participant. The researcher also used snowball recruitment procedures, which have beenrecommended for diverse sub-populations and populations withseveral specific demographic criteria such as in this proposed study (Sadler, Lee, Lim, & Fullerton, 2010). Researchers requested that participants provide information about the study and how toparticipate to other potentially interested students who meet criteria. Students who responded to the email were screened with a short questionnaire to see that they met participant criteria.Bianca was 19 years old duringthe period of her interviews and text message reports. She identified as a “sophomore” in college, as female, and as Hispanic in response to the demographic question of race and ethnicity. She was born in the U.S. as a second-generation immigrant, as her parents made the journey from Mexico to the U.S. She identified as a first-generation collegestudent. She explained on her demographic questionnaire that her parents completed “some” high school and never took any CS courses. Bianca indicated that she was part of a Latinasorority and the organization Hermanas Unidas. She had taken four CS courses prior to the first interview and was enrolled in two during the academic period of the interviews and text reports. She wrote in response to how CS impacted her journey as a student, “they [CS courses] balance out the hard workloadwith Chemistry. The CScourses help me to enjoy each quarter with fun, exciting, and informative classes.” Elisa was 22 years old whileparticipating in the interviews and text message reports. She identified as Latina and Chicana, female, and a first-year transfer student in her third year of post-secondary education. She was born in the U.S. to parents who made the immigration journey from Mexico, making her a second-generation immigrant. She reported that her parents completed “some” high school in Mexico and did not ever take CS classes. Elisa identified as being part of the Equal Opportunity Program at her current university, a program dedicated to support services of first-generation college students and students from backgrounds underrepresented in the academy. She had taken five CS courses prior to the first interview and two during the academic period of the interviews and text messages. She answered that she did experience significant impact on her educational journey through CS but did not elaborate on the demographic questionnaire.Isabel was 20 years old atthe time of interviews and text message reports. She identifies as Latinx, female, and as a third-year college student. She was born in the U.S. to parents who emigrated tothe U.S. from Mexico, making her a second-generation immigrant. She explained on the demographic questionnaire that her father completed his GED in U.S. and that her mother completed high school in Mexico, which makes her a first-generation college student. Isabel indicated that she was part of the Student Commission on Racial Equality at her university. She had taken five CS courses prior to the first interview and was enrolled in two at the time of the first interview. She indicatedthat “yes” CS had significantly impacted her educational journey butdid not provide any further explanation on the demographic questionnaire.Emilia was 33 years old atthe time of interviews and text message reports, giving her a designation by her university campus of “non-traditional student.” She identified as Mexican American, a cis-female, and “junior” transfer student. She indicated that she is a first-generation college student and second-generation immigrant, her parents making the immigration journey to the U.S. Shealso indicted that her mother completed junior high school and her father completed elementary school. She reported not being part of any campus organizations or ethnic-affinity organizations. She had taken seven CS courses prior to the first interview and was taking one course at the time of the same interview. She responded “yes” to the question about whether or not CS had an impact on her journey as student butdid not offer further details of that impact on her demographic questionnaire.Alejandra was20 years old atthe time of interviewsand text message reports. They identified as Latinx, gender non-conforming, and a third-year college student. They indicated being a first-generation college student, their father completing elementary school and their mother taking some courses at a community college for occupational accreditation. They indicated being part of the resource center for sexual and gender diversity on her university’s campus. They had enrolled in six CS courses prior to the first interview and two during the academic period of interviews and text reports. Alejandra responded to the question of CS impacting their journey as a student, “I actually decided to change my major after my firstChicanx Studies course.”Sandra was 22 years old atthe time of the interviews and text message reports. She identified as Mexican, undocumented, female, and as a third-year transfer student. She indicated that she is a first-generation college student and immigrant, making the journey from Mexico with parents to the U.S. She wrote on the questionnaire that both of her parents completed “some” high school but did not complete their diplomas. Sandra reported being part of her campus’ undocumented student coalition as well as La Escuelita, an organization offering tutoring and other services to Latinx and other underserved communities before college. She completed three CS courses prior to the first interview and was enrolled in three courses during the period of interviews and text message reports. In responding to the question of whether CS significantly impacted her educational journey, Sandra explained,“I feel like I am learning so much that I did know before.”Daniella was 23 years old at the time of interviews and text message reports. She identified asMexican, undocumented, female, and as a “senior” transfer student. She indicated that she is both a first-generation college student and immigrant, making the journey with her parents from Mexico. She reported that her mother completed some high school inMexico. Daniella indicated that she was part of any campus organizations and owed that to her status as a commuter-student, previously travelling from a city about 40 miles away to campus for classes. Daniella had completed nine courses in CS at the time of the first interview and was taking two more during the period of interviews and text message reports. When she responded to the question of whether CS had impacted her significantly as a student in her educational journey, she explained “I think I’ve learned a lot about Latinos in higher education and they’ve also motivated me to do more. I think if it wasn’t for that, I would have majored in sociology.”Procedures Those meeting criteria were invited for the firstface-to-faceinterview with the researcher in a convenient location for the participant such as a research office on the university campus. These interviews represented the first of three phases for the study, the second being a phase oftext message exchanges capturing experiences while enrolled in a CS course. At the initial interview, participants were first given a demographic questionnaire to gather contextual information including age, gender identification, ethnicity, whether or not first-generation college student, and their generation in family’s immigration history (See Appendix C).Before beginning the interview, the researcher reviewed informed consent forms with participants (See Appendix D), outlining their rights as a participant, the balance of inherent risks and benefits, and relevant psychological resource, and answering any questions. All interviews were audio recordedwith participant consent. Each initial interview lasted 1 to 2 hours. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and were then analyzed using the formal steps in transcendental phenomenology. The audio files and interview transcripts were stored on a password-protected computer in the locked office of the researcher. Audio files of the interviews will be destroyed after completion of the study. This study consistedof three phasesand students were be offered $50 incentivesin the form of Amazon gift cards, given in increments of $15 and $35 at both the completion of the first interview and completion of the final interviewrespectively.The secondphase of the study included interactions via text message while students concurrently took CS courses. The first set of text questions and prompts were sent to them by the researcher 2-3 weeks into their current course and then again two weeks later. Participants were invited torespond as soon as possible, while not interfering with their studies or interrupting their classroom experiences. These text questions and prompts were aimed at collecting participant experiences while participants concurrently experiencedthe phenomena, promoting“fresh access”to the phenomena (Moustakas, 1994). After the text prompts, students engagedin a finalsemi-structured interview with the researcher in the final two weeks or shortly after the end of their last CS course of the year to understand how students described the process of being in CS and its influence on their educational journey and goals. These interviews lasted between 25 and 60minutes.InstrumentsSemi-structured interview protocols. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data on participants’lived experiencesand processesofengaging in Chicanx Studies trainingas called for by phenomenologicalmethodology(deMarrias & Lapan,2003). The flexibility of semi-structured interviews allowed for theasking of follow-up questions not in the original interview protocol. This becameespecially important in the axial, or relating to the researcher’s own related experiences,co-construction ofdata between interviewer and interviewee,as bothresearcher and participantstriedto understand their lived experienceof CS.Questions from thefirst semi-structured interview protocol included those which established how CS has already impacted students,including: “what was CS been like for you?” and “howhas CS impacted you outside class?” The second semi-structured interview protocol involved questions such as “has anything changed since our first interview?” and “what have your learned about CS?” (See Appendix Afor Semi-Structured Interview Protocols).Text message protocol. The text message interactions were centered upon experiences while participants were concurrently enrolled in CS. Prompts included questions such as: “What haveyour CS courses been like?” and “How would you describe the environment around CS?” These protocols were piloted with a CS student before overall administration to participants to address any confusion in the protocol questions and hone their effectiveness with full participants.AnalysisPhenomenological research was chosenas the most appropriate methodological approach to answer the question of what is essential to the experience of being a CS major. Moustakas’ transcendental phenomenology (1994) was the design base for this study. The researcher sought to understand the “essence” (Creswell & Poth, 2018) of the lived CS major phenomenon. The transcendental phenomenological approach was appropriate for the research questions and participants because this study looked at a group of individuals sharing a specific socioculturalcontext that producesa lived phenomenon only experienced bythis group. The researcher engaged in bracketing, which involves exploring personal position and experiences around the phenomenon to be explored. The researcher engaged in written reflection asto how his own experiences with CS and activism inspired by participation in CS relate to the questions begin asked of a current undergraduate population.  This exploration is an active dialogue entailing the processing and setting aside of researcher experiences that may influence the researcher’s contributions toco-construction and their analysis of the data. After the bracketing process, interviews were conducted and transcribed before beginningthe analytical process.The researcher engaged in horizonalization, looking at statements made by CS students from interview and text message data around their experiences in CS and the influencing factors they observed. These statements wereanalyzed in terms of their significance in relation to the research questions. Significant statements were grouped by thematic meaning and analyzed in terms of their textural or structural qualities. Statements with textural properties were used to describe the reported experiences, or “what” it is to experience living as a CS major (Creswell & Poth, 2018). Structural statements were used to compose a description of contextual factors, explaining “how” these experiences happened as they did. The researcherthen developed a composite statement that outlines the essence of the lived experience of being a CS major. This statementwill describe the essence of the CS experience for these participants."

            "output": "Research Questions and HypothesisThe purpose of this study was to investigate the hypothesized relations between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, hope, belongingness, and career choice satisfactionamong Black graduate students in school psychology programs. The methodology section outlines the methods that wereused to examine the research questions including a description of the research design, participants, sampling procedures, instruments, and research procedures usedto investigate the following research questions:RQ1:Are self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, hope, and belongingnesssignificant predictors of Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction?

H0:Hope and belongingness do not mediatethe relation between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, and Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction.Research Design and VariablesIn this study a quantitative approach using a non-experimental, cross-sectionaldesign was applied. A review of relevant literature revealed that quantitative studiesfocusing on Black students in graduate school psychology programs were limited and couldbe relevant in expanding recruitment efforts (Chandler, 2011; Pham et al., 2021; Proctor & Truscott, 2012). Non-experimental research is an approach that neither relies on the manipulation of variables nor assigns participants to treatmentconditions (Bonds-Raacke & Raacke, 2014). This type of research examines how thevariables in the study are related to one another, explores phenomena in real lifesituations, and studies the variables in the study as they exist (Bonds-Raacke& Raacke, 2014). This design was appropriatefor this study because there was no intent tomanipulate the variables, as with experimental research (Bonds-Raacke & Raacke, 2014). The focus was to examine the relations between self-efficacy, outcome expectations,andtask valueamong Black graduate students in school psychology programs.Cross-sectional research is an approach where researchers explore the factorswithin a particular population at a given point in time (Bethlehem, 1999). This design was also appropriate for this study as the focus is to collect and examinedata surrounding the experiences of the participants.ParticipantsRecruitmentIn this study, eligible participants werestudents who self-identifiedas Black or African American (or endorsedCaribbean or African heritage) currently enrolled in graduate school psychology programs. Participants should also be actively matriculating in their school psychology training program.Sample SizeA power analysis was performedusing G*Power software to determine the target sample size for the analysis. The power analysis was conducted for a multiple linear regression with five predictors and assumed a medium effect size (f2=0.15), a significance level of .05, and a power level of .80. The results of the power analysis showed that the target sample size for this analysis was 92 participants. Description of Study ParticipantsParticipants consistedof 112 self-identifying Black students currently enrolled in school psychology programs.Among the participants, 45.5% (n=51) reported their age being between 25 to 29, 25.9% (n=29) were between 18 to 24, 22.4% (n=25) were between 30 to 34, 3.5% (n=4) were between 35 to 39, and 2.7%(n=3) were 40 and over. Most of the sample identified as African American or Black (n=74, 66%). Some participants also identified as other Mixed Race or nationalities such as Haitian American and Middle Eastern (n=25, 22.4%). The remaining participants identified as Afro-Caribbean or West Indian (n=4, 3.5%), Multiethnic (n=4, 3.5%), African (n=3, 2.7%), and Afro-Latino/a/x (n=1, 0.9%) with one participant missing this data. For the participants’ highest degree earned, 50.9% (n=57) had earned a master’s degree, 45.5% (n=51) had earned a bachelor’s degree, 1.8% (n=2) had earned a doctorate, and the remaining 1.8% either earned an associate degree (n=1) or endorsed earning some degree (n=1) other than those listed. Most of the participants self-identified as female (e.g., woman, female, cis-gender female) at 90.0% (n=100) whereas only 9.1% (n=11) self-identified as male. As it relates to marital status, 83.0% (n=93) of participants were single, 14.3% (n=16) were married or in a domestic partnership,and 2.7% (n=3) were divorced. Of the participants who reported their family’s household income, 31.3% (n=35) made less than $25,000, 20.5% (n=23) made between $25,000 to $34,999, 20.5% (n=23) made between $35,000 to $59,999, 14.3% (n=16) made between $60,000 to $99,999 and 4.5% (n=5) made between $100,000 to $149,000, and 3.6% (n=4) made over $150,000. 5.4% (n=6) of the participants did not know or preferred not to respond to this question.See Table 1. Additional demographic data shows that most of the of participants 65.2% (n=73) endorsed that they use loans to fund their current education program. Regarding assistantships and fellowships, 50% (n=56) of the participants endorsed receiving this type of funding. Of the participants who endorsed receiving scholarships or grants to fund their program, 41.1% (n=46) endorsed this type of funding. Most of the participants in the study were enrolled in doctoral programs (45.5%, n=51), 33% (n=37) were enrolled in specialist programs, and 18.8% (n=21) were enrolled in masters’ programs. of the participants who endorsed being in “Other” types of programs each filled in that they were enrolled in hybrid masters and specialist programs. The majority of participants’ school psychology programs were accredited by both NASP and APA (57.1%, n=64) with 34.8% (n=39) being accredited by NASP only2. Also, only 16.1% (n=18) of participants attended HBCUs for their undergraduate degree and 8.9% (n=10) currently attend an HBCU. See Table 2.wasmade available to the first 100 participants who completedthe forms. This monetary incentive was made possible thanks to awards from the Kennedy/Graves Research Fund.InstrumentsDemographic QuestionnaireThe demographic questionnaire wasused to collectbasic demographic data about participants. Thisincludedquestions about the participants’ age, racial, ethnic, or cultural background, gender,highest degree earned, maritalstatus, family household income, and how they fund their current education program. Participants werealso asked about the type of school psychology program they were enrolled in, their programs accrediting organization, andwhetherthey attended an HBCU as an undergraduate or are currently enrolled at anHBCU.Self-efficacy ScaleThe New General Self-Efficacy Scaleassesses the extent to which an individual believes they can achieve their goals despite challenges. The scale has eight items with responses being on a 5-point Likert scale indicating1 = “strongly disagree”, 2 = “disagree”, 3 = “neither agree nor disagree”, 4 = “agree”, or 5 = “strongly agree”. Some examples of the items on the scale are “I will be able to achieve most of the goals that I set for myself” and “When facing difficult tasks, I am certain I will accomplish them”. There exist several measures of self-efficacy. However, the New General Self-Efficacy Scale developed by Chen et al. (2001) demonstrates greater reliability and validity than other measures of self-efficacy (Scherbaum et al., 2006).In prior studies, the internal consistency reliability was found to be high for the New General Self-Efficacy Scale with alpha = .86 and .90 when administrated subsequently.In the current study, Cronbach’s alpha = .83,indicating good reliability.The overall score is calculated by taking the average of participants'ratings with higher score being interpreted as endorsing a higher sense of general self-efficacy. The mean score on the scale was 4.36 (SD=0.49), indicating that, on average, participants agreed with the items. Table C.1 (Appendix C)summarizesthe descriptive statistics for the eight items on the New General Self-Efficacy Scale. Outcome ExpectationsScaleThe outcome expectations scale used in this study indicates whether students have positive outcome expectations for graduating with a degree in school psychology and is a slightly modified version of Lent et al.’s (2008) version.The scale was modified to focus specifically on school psychologyas opposed to the computing sciences. The question on this scale reads as “Graduating with a degree in school psychology will likely allow me to...”. Theoutcome expectationsscale has ten items with responses being on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree”, 2 = “disagree”, 3 = “neither agree nor disagree”, 4 = “agree”, or5= “strongly agree”. The scale scores were created by calculating the mean of the scale with higher values being interpreted as greater positive outcome expectations for graduating with a degree in school psychology.An example of questions included inthe scale are, “Graduating with a degree in school psychology will likely allow me to earn an attractive salary”and “Graduating with a degree in school psychology will likely allow me to do work that can make a difference in people’s lives”.Lent et al. reported a coefficient alpha of .90 for their instrument. Bocanegra et. al (2016) adapted the scale to specifically evaluate participants outcome expectations for graduating from a school psychology program. Bocanegra et al. also reported a coefficient alpha of .90. In the current study, Cronbach’s alpha was = .76 indicating acceptable reliability. The overall outcome expectations score wascalculated and used to predict Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction. The mean score on this scale was 4.19 (SD=0.45). Table C.2 (Appendix C)displaysdescriptive statistics for the Outcome Expectations Scale. Subjective Task Value Questionnaire Thesix-itemSubjective TaskValue Questionnaireevaluatesa person’s judgment of how interesting, useful, and important course contents or specific activities are to that individual. The responses of participants werebased on their level of agreement with the following statements using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree”, 2 = “moderately disagree”, 3 = “disagree”, 4 = “neither agree nor disagree”, 5 = “agree”, 6 = “moderately agree”,and7 = “strongly agree”. Examples of items included on the questionnaire are “I think I will be able to use what I learn in this degree program in my life” and “I am very interested in the content area of my degree program”. The Subjective Task Value Questionnaire is a tool that was adapted from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich et al., 1991).Pintrich et al. (1991) reported a coefficient alpha of .87 for the six-item task value subscale that measures the beliefs of students regarding task value to them. In the current study, Cronbach’s alpha was found to = .89 indicating goodreliability. The overall subjective task value score wase calculated and used to predict Black graduate school psychology students’ degree of satisfaction with their career choice. The mean score on this scale was 6.25 (SD=0.86). Table C.5 (Appendix C) summarizesdescriptive statistics for the six items on the Subjective Task Value Questionnaire. Alignment with NASP Domains.NASP (2021) has recently revised the ten domains within its comprehensive and integrated services model which guide school psychologists to best meet the needs of students, families, and communities. The ten domains are listed as follows: •Domain 1 –Data-Based Decision-Making•Domain 2 –Consultation and Collaboration•Domain 3 –Academic Interventions and Instructional Supports•Domain 4 –Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions,•Domain 5 –School-Wide Practices to Promote Learning•Domain 6 –Services to Promote Safe and Supportive Schools•Domain 7 –Family, School, and Community Collaboration•Domain 8 –Equitable Practices for Diverse Student Populations•Domain 9 –Research and Evidence-Based Practice•Domain 10 –Legal, Ethical, and Professional PracticeFor each domain, participants were asked to rate the degree to which they feltaligned withthe domain on a scale of 1 = “No Alignment”, 2 = “Poor Alignment”, 3 = “Moderate Alignment”, 4 = “Strong Alignment”, or 5 = “Full Alignment”. The inclusion of this brief questionnaire helpsto understand which aspects of the work Black school psychology student’s value most or least in their training. These responses will be beneficial in further development of recruitment strategies that may be specifically aimed at increasing representation of Black students in school psychology. The mean for this questionnaire was 4.34 (SD=0.59). Table C.6 (Appendix C)displays descriptive statistics for the ten item NASP Domain Alignment questionnaire. Adult (Trait) Hope ScaleThe Adult (Trait) Hope Scale(AHS; Snyder et al., 1991) is a 12-item, self-report inventory that measures dispositional hope in individuals ages 15 and older (Snyder, 2000). The scale is comprised of: (1) four items measuring agency, (2) four items measuring pathways, and (3) four distracter (filler) items. The four agency items focus on one’s sense of successful determination in relation to their goals, while the four pathways’ items focus on one’s cognitive appraisals of their ability to produce means for both overcoming goal-related obstacles and reaching their goals. The four distracter items were omitted in this study to reduce the number of items participants were required to respond to. Participants respond to an 8-point, Likert scale ranging from 1 = “definitely false” 2 =“mostly false”, 3 = somewhat false”, 4 = “slightly false”, 5 = “slightly true”, 6 = “somewhat true”, 7 = “mostly true”, and 8 = “definitely true”.The Cronbach’s alpha for the scale in the current study indicated good reliability alpha = .88. The overall hope score wascalculated and used to predict Black graduate school psychology students’ satisfaction with their career choice. The mean score for this scale was 6.63 (SD=0.99). Descriptive statistics for the Adult Trait Hope Scale are summarized in Table C.7 (Appendix C).Sense of Belonging SurveyThe Sense of Belonging Survey used in this study measures the degree to which students feel they belong on their campuses and was adapted by O’Meara et al. (2017) from the sense of belonging construct and items that are included in the multi-institutional study of leadership (MSL). The MSL (2017) is a multi-year study that focuses on evaluating student needs in higher education.There are seven survey items with responses based on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree”, 2 = “disagree”, 3 = “neither agree nor disagree”, 4 = “agree”, and 5 = “strongly agree”. Some examples of the items include “The sense of fit between my values and those of my department/unit” and “I feel valued as a person in my department/unit”. In previous studies, the coefficient alpha for the sense of belonginess items was.86. In the current study, alpha was .81. The overall sense of belongingness score was calculated and used to predict Black graduate school psychology students’ career satisfaction. The mean for this survey was 3.74 (SD=0.71). Descriptive statistics for the Sense of Belongingness Survey are summarized in Table C.3 (Appendix C).Career Choice Satisfaction QuestionnaireThe Career Choice Satisfaction items used in this study wasmodified from Kovach Clark et al.’s (2009) study which predicted burnout and career choice satisfaction among counseling psychology graduate students. The modified scale focused on the field of school psychology rather than counseling psychology. The seven items included to assess career choice satisfaction requiredrespondents to rate each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = “very dissatisfied or very unlikely”, 2 = “moderately dissatisfied or moderately unlikely disagree”, 3 = neither dissatisfied nor satisfied”, 4 = “moderately satisfied or moderately likely”, and5 “very satisfied or very likely”. Some examples of the item on the questionnaire are “How satisfied are you with your choice of school psychology as a career?” and “How likely is it that you will make a career change outside of school psychology?”. One item (“How likely is it that someday you will make a career change outside of schoolpsychology?”) wasreverse scored so that higher numbers indicatedless likelihood of career change. In the current study, Cronbach’s alpha was equal to .79, indicating good reliability. The mean score for this questionnaire was 4.12 (SD=0.62). Descriptive statistics for the Career Choice Satisfaction Questionnaireare summarized in Table C.4 (Appendix C).Data AnalysesThe data weredownloadedas an electronic spreadsheet file from Qualtrics and imported into SPSS for analysis. Composite scores werecomputed for each research variable (self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, hope, belongingness, and career choice satisfaction) according to the instrument authors’ instructions. Descriptive statistics werecalculated for each of the research variables and demographic variables. Means and standard deviations werecomputed for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages werecomputed for categorical variables.The research questions wereaddressed using multiple regression analysis via theHayes (2017) PROCESS macro in SPSS. Multiple regression was anappropriate statistical analysisto determine if multiple predictor variables wererelated to thedependentvariable and if any variables mediatedthoserelationships(Baron & Kenny, 1986). In this analysis, the predictor variablesareself-efficacy, outcome expectations,andtask value;the dependentvariable is career choice satisfaction;and the mediatingvariablesarehope and belongingness.The analysis wasconducted using a series of regressions."

            "output": "This dissertation study contributes to the understanding of how students participating in Chicanx Studies academic courses describe their psychological experiences, using transcendental phenomenological qualitative research and multiple data collection methods. Participants described encountering CS and its environment, undergoing psychological gains and transformations, building academic achievementon a foundation of psychological thriving, and increasing their commitment to earning their degrees and pursuing future goals. The triangulation of data from initial interviews, experiential data from text messages, and final exit interview data drew connections from students’ past and fresh experiences to form a conceptual model of the psychological and academic gains associated with CS. Contributions resulted from the exploration of challenges faced by students, psychological gains experienced, family support, goals influenced by ChicanxStudies, professor relationships, curricular interactions, peer relationships, and environmental considerations. This chapter explores the implications of results with current literature around CS, Chicanx and Latinx student populations, as well as statuses such as first-generation and undocumented students. Discussion of significant findings will be followed by exploration of study limitations, potential future directions for this line of research, and recommendations forpractice and implementation.ConceptualModel for Chicanx StudiesThe core finding that binds the textural and structural findings is the emergence of a basic, tentative (to be subjected to further studies)theoretical framework for the phenomenological experience of CS(see Figure 1). The conceptual model captures the essence of the CS phenomenon and begins to explain the relationship between the textural and structural findings. Challengesand barrierssuch as transferring from community college, homesickness, and discrimination as uniquely experienced by Chicanx and Latinx students, along with significant psychological and academic gains. This framingasserts the importance of the foundational quality of participants’ psychological gains, most notably lessened impostor feelings, self-efficacy, positive ethnic identity, sense of belonging, and critical consciousness. These aspects of psychological thrivingserve as a foundation upon which academic gains, such as increased achievement, motivations, and pursuit of positive goals. The academic thriving students described in this study occurred only after their significant psychological needs and conditions were satisfied. The CS environment facilitated the satisfaction of essentialpsychological thrivingthrough crucial structural experiences such as professor relationships, peer relationships, interaction with unique CS curricula, as well as subtler environmental conditions.Addressing psychological components of participants’ intersectional identities of Chicanx or Latinxand first-generation college student (and sometimes first-generation transfer student) through CS facilitated later academic thrivingamong these participants. For example, some students better adjusted to college, as defined by increased academic performance and motivation, after CS addressed aspects of their homesickness. Another process experienced by students involved CS’ attention to discrimination through an inclusive environment of peers and educators who facilitated interconnectedness through shared experiences. Thepsychological boon of interconnected among peers and professors often motivated students within CS classrooms and, more surprisingly, as well as classrooms in other subjects where they previouslystruggled. The challenges faced by transfer students in this study necessitated the recovering of academic self-efficacy in the nourishing environment of CS to return to positive levels of academic motivation and performance.This study uniquely contributes to the literature on CS by offering a conceptual model to understand how CS (in this case, but possibly other ethnic studies programs) can positively impact the psychological and academic thriving of Chicanx and Latinx college students. Of course, academic success will likely contribute to therelative psychological thrivingof most students in some way. This model, however, begins to explain how Chicanx and Latinx students must navigate their own set of unique barriers to find academic success incollege and persist towards their goals. CS addresses their unique barriers by providing the conditions for significantly corrective emotional experiences (Bridges, 2006). Students in this study expressed how unpacking and processing experiences from being teased for Mexican foods at lunch to holding the possibility that their parents could be deported at any moment in an environment that was safe, validating, non-judgmental, and shared. These participants’ shared experiences around immigration and working-classstruggle in the U.S. are precise examplesof how the implications of this study’s results point to educational processes that are uniquely Chicanx and Latinx.Making phenomenological studies responsive to transgender participants in applied psychology research helps service an important gap in attention and service to the transgender population (Singh & Shelton, 2011). Recruitmentefforts could have been more deliberate to include transgender perspectives through connection with trans-student organizations and studentgroups on campus. Specific attention should also be paid to the justified sensitivity to how transgender populations and participants will be represented in research as well. When researching around social justice themes such as in this study, efforts to be inclusive of transgender and gender diverse communities seem appropriate and necessary to strengthen social justice. The potential benefitof holding stories for transgender students in CS, including their own psychological and academic trajectories, with the goals of social justice and spirit of inclusivity as expressed by participants deserves exploration. Thestudy also failed to capture Chicanx and Latinx male voices. Considerationmust be given to how the design and content of the study contributed to thisfailure. Perhaps malestudents in CS do not feel as comfortable or seen in a study that looks specifically at how CS hasimpacted their journeysasstudents.The study’s conceptual model also suffers from the lack of inclusion ofmale voices. Another process of engagement mightexistfor male students in CS that doesnot get voiced or examined. The impact on psychological functioning and academictrajectory possibly paint a significantly different picturefor male CS students. The design of semi-structured interviews and text message exchangescouldalso be less accessible to male participantsin a study of this naturefor a variety of reasons. Alternate methods or meta-research on Chicanx and Latinx male participation need consideration and examination in hopes of attracting these voices toilluminate the CS experience. CS may not be functioning in the same manner for male studentsandmay be functioning in other important pathwaysthat need understanding. The design,recruitment methods, andthe field ofapplied psychology itself may act as barriers to participation.More direct and intentional recruitment of male voices may also increase participation.Another design limitation arosein the final interview phase of the study. Much of the data from this phase did not add new themes to the data or provide any new facets or components to existing themes. One explanation is that thisphase became futile in the collection of this specific data in this study, as it merely seemed to recap data from recent text message exchanges and did not build any new thematic data from the initial interviews and text messages. Another explanation could bethe nature of questions inthe final interview protocol (Appendix C). The questions themselves may not have elicited any new data because they were not asking for new data. Perhaps these questions only asked students to review previous experiences. This phase did allow for the possibilities of new experiences or realizations to be shared at the end of the grading period, but none of the final interviews produced new realizations. The initial interview and text messages produced rich data to explain a conceptual model of the relationship between psychological and academic gains. The final interviews reiterated this process and the main thematic components butdid not add to them.The text message phase of the study produced rich data but also featureddesign complications. Text messages were sent out 2-3 weeks after the initial interview, depending on how late in themarking period the initial interview commenced. Students were instructed to reply as soon as possible without interfering with their academic responsibilities and not while actually in class. The responses came in a variety of time frames: some within hours, others within a week, and others over a week later, but not exceeding more than two weeks. Collecting text message data was much lessorderly than the initial and final interviews, which were all finished in under two hours each and in one sitting. It is unclear how this impacted the actual data produced in the study, but the varying time frames produces an unknown. Perhaps there is minimal impact and part of using text messages to adapt to an undergraduate-age population also involves collecting data in varying time frames depending on the person replying to texts. This limitation is easier to endure than others mentioned, but attentionto text message time frames in subsequent qualitative studies could enlighten researchers on the impacts of varying time frames around collecting specific data types.The text message phase is also where on participant dropped out of the study. Elisa wasunresponsive to text messages and repeated attempts to remind her of the next phases of the study and the incentives available. As seen in the results and discussion sections, Elisa contributed rich data to the study from her initial interview,but it is unfortunate to miss out on the potential for rich data in the remaining phases of the study. Incentives perhaps undermined the potential for attrition in this study as all other participants finished and collected but were not enough to keep all participantsin the study.Recruitment forthis study elicited participants who were very enthusiastic, for the most part, about CS. Future directions could include studies of those who were not enthusiastic, or even dropped out, to better understand the full range of the phenomenon from varied perspectives.The psychological components of thrivingassociated with CS participation warrant continued research and exploration after their appearance in this study’s data. The nature and interrelationship of impostor feelings, self-efficacy, positive ethnic identity, sense of belonging, and critical consciousness are forming an emergent model for how CS produces specific psychological processes to be understood. Measures that exist or need to be developed around these constructs could be explored for their relationships. Furtherqualitative exploration could be focused on these constructs themselves to understand the process underneath even further. This study began to uncover these gains but more specific exploration of each could tell researchers more on how CS is specifically producing these gains.Chicanx and Latinx students will benefit from greater understanding of how professor and peer relationships work specifically in their psychological and academic favor. The specific aspects of professor relationships that facilitate psychological growth are important to further understand. In this study, professors were seen as approachable, supportive, personable, passionate, and inspiring, but how these qualities came acrossto students and how they specifically impacted them is only recently being understood by researchers, including in this study. How and why other CS students impacted participants was clear to some extent. Being the same race and ethnicity, sharing experiences, and validating each were also discussed by participants as significant components of the peer relationship process but further modeling the relationship and processes within these experiences only enhances our understanding of CS and how its studentsfunction within and without the space.Further exploration of aspects of CS environment is required as well. Data from things like use of Spanish language and music was not as rich as some of the major themes discussed in this study, but their appearances in the data warrant further exploration of the perhapsless obvious factors contributing to psychological thriving. How to use language and music effectively in CS and other course environments to encourage more psychological comfort and adjustment for Chicanx and Latinx students, as well as other identities in these settings, is important. Other subtle factors would certainly emerge if similar qualitative methods spent significant time on only environmental factors. Thus, research along this line could be fruitful and contribute to the growing body of literature on CS.Understanding how other races, ethnicities, and identities experience CS is also important. Students from all backgrounds can end up in CS courses because of general education requirementsor interests in the subject regardless of their own shared identity. How the experience and benefit from CS course environments is also vitally important to understand. Enhancing how they experience CS in a way that contributes to broader campus inclusionand safety for Chicanx, Latinx, and all other student populations.From a design perspective, further use of text message data collection proved very valuable for this study. The multi-method approach to collecting data ensured past, rich experiences ofCS were captured, as well as fresh experiences once students were more aware of the significance of their individual interactions with CS. As mentioned before, the semi-structured interviews were effective in producing both textural and structural data butwereoften presentedby participants from the perspective of textural, phenomenological experience. Text messages were much more adept at capturing the structural components and their relationship to textural experiences, which was vitally important to the study as well. Additional studies looking to balance their collection of textural and structural data should look athow combining semi-structured interviews with text message interactions, particularly with student populations, as enhances both historicand fresh experiential data collection.RecommendationsResearcher Gina Ann Garcia developed a typology of Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI) identities (2018) to determine the extent to which they positively impact the academic outcomes as well as the cultural representations of Latinx students. The identitytypes ranged from Latinx-enrolling HSIs, with low academic and low cultural service, to Latinx-serving, which was high on both dimensions. In many ways, this typology is parallel to the CS conceptualmodel of addressing psychological and adjustment needs along with academic. Both frameworks at the core acknowledge the importance of developing student thrivingmore holistically for Latinx students. The recommendations of this study are also similarly aimed at developing CSprograms and campus that are student-serving and not simply student-enrolling. Recommendations to expand CS’ influence, develop well-rounded CS professors, and challenge other academic environments to learn from CS are all captured and bound by this framework.The first and primary recommendation is to support and expand CS programs as much as possible. This is a complex and precise goal. Generally, college campuses with even small Chicanx and Latinx student populations should consider the scope with which they are offering CS. The psychological barriers students outlined in this study could guide college campuses in assessing for the specific type and scope of the psychological needs of their Chicanx and Latinx student populations. This could ensure that the number of CS professors, courses, and seats is as close to need as possible. Achieving this level of reach for CS obviously requires institutional and funding support. Expanding CS does not need to be limited to expansion of the CSprograms themselves.This wisdom derived from the student data in this study identifies specific psychological gains to emphasize in the service of students. Assessing how professors and administrators in CS programs are producing these psychological gains, challenging other academic environments to acknowledge Chicanx and Latinx students and their unique psychological needs, and exploring how the campus more broadly is serving students becomes part of this goal.The unique role of CS professors as explained through the results in this study highlight the significant amount of responsibility they take on, especially in the early and formative experiences of CS. Students in this study identified how they came to CS with low self-efficacy and belonging, having experienced discrimination and homesickness, and CS becomes an environment that at times can hold all of that for students. A large part of that labor is supplied by CS professors. CS provided personal support, validation, and essentially counseling intimes of crisis. CS departments want to be sure that professors are capable and prepared to experience the broad rolesthey will fill, as well as support them in these efforts. Attention should be paid to the emotional, cognitive, and physical labor provided by CS professors and the level of psychological support they need. This may also distract from their research responsibilities, so adjustments to how CS professors are evaluated may also be necessary. Compensation for the varied roles and intensive emotional labor should beexamined as well.Challenging other academic departments to acknowledge and contribute to the service of Chicanx and Latinx student populations is also necessary. The psychological barriers and wounds endured in other course settingsshift the labor of healing onto CS professors, administration, and other program resources. Numerous other academic programs were identified as the site of psychological distress, which was then attended to through CS. Campus faculty should be trained onthe unique needs of their entire student populations andhow to be as responsive to these needs as possible through their pedagogy. Promoting Chicanx and Latinx student thrivingshould not fall only on CS and other Chicanx and Latinx-targeted student programming. Truly servingChicanx and Latinx student populations will require more expansive campus focus on psychologicalthriving."

            "tl;dr": "",         
            "abstract": "There is a critical need to diversify the field ofschool psychology to better serve the educational and mental health needsof ethnically and racially minoritizedyouth and their families. This dissertation study focuses specifically on increasing the representation of Black school psychologists. Previous literature shows that Black youth have been historically marginalized and discriminated against in the U.S. system of education. Therefore, increasing representation of Black school psychologistsis critically important tobetter serve Black youth.In striving to increase the recruitment and retention of Black school psychologists, this study aims to provide an understanding about the reasons why Black students choose school psychology and whether they are satisfied with their training. Using multiple regression analysis,this studyexaminedself-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task valueas variables predicting career satisfaction among Black graduate school psychology students. Results indicated that outcome expectations and task value were significant predictors of career choice satisfaction. Hope and belongingness did not mediate the relation between self-efficacy, task value outcome expectations, and career choice satisfaction. Exploratory analyses were also conducted on alignment with NASP Domains and observed across doctoral, masters, and specialist students. Implications for research and practice within the field of school psychology are discussed.",

            "section": "discussion",
            "input": "",         
            "output": "Prior to proceeding with the mediation analysis, a secondary multiple linear regression model was conducted to evaluate whether self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task value predicted hope or belongingness, respectively. The results show that 48.1%of the variance in hope can be accounted for by the three predictors collectively. Yet, self-efficacy and task value were significant positive predictors of hope, whileoutcome expectation was not a significant a significant predictor. Further, self-efficacy, task value, and outcome expectations were not significant predictors of belongingness. Previous research shows that self-efficacy and hope account for significant variance in academic performance (Adelabu, 2008). As such, the results of this regression indicatethat individuals with a higher senseof self-efficacy also endorse a higher degree of hope. Belongingnessdid not have any relation to self-efficacy, task value, and outcome expectations. Although previous studies have shown belonging to play a role in career interest among underrepresented students, it remains unclear how sense of belonging impacts career choice satisfaction. There is also limited evidence related to understanding how sense of belonging operates to affect cognitive factors, such as task value and outcome expectations, that influence career choice among students in school psychology.  It was expected that self-efficacy might influence sense of belonginess given that belonging is considered to be an important contributor to achievement and motivation (Finn& Frone, 2004).Nevertheless, these insignificant findings have implications that may help researchers craft more meaningful contextual questions, which will be discussed further in the implications. Hope and Belonginess Show No Evidence of Mediation Between Self-Efficacy, Task Value, Outcome Expectations and Career Choices ResearchQuestion 1Bexplored whether hope or belongingness mediated therelation between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task valuewith career choice satisfaction among Black graduate school psychology students. The findings yielded that hope accounted for no more than 4% of the indirect effectobservedbetween self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, and career choice satisfaction. Further, sense of belonging accounted for no more than 1% of the indirect effect observed between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, and career choice satisfaction.These results indicate that despite self-efficacy and task value being predictors of hope, hope as a mediating variable did not show any significant link between these predictorvariables and the dependent variable, career choice satisfaction. Additionally, task value and outcome expectations were found to significantly predict career choice satisfaction independent of hope. Belongingness also showed no significant link between the independent variables and the outcome variables. Given these findings, hypothesis 1B is not supported. Previous studies have found hope toact as a protective factor for students from marginalized backgrounds (Hirsch et al., 2012). The literature that specifically targets graduate students provides further evidence that hope may assist in helping graduate students to overcome the demands of higher education and coping with its challenges (Alexander & Onwuegbuzie, 2007;Kennedy et al., 2009).The current studyaimed to understand the role of hope in relation to career choice satisfaction and expand the literature in this regard, which is not typical in research related to career and vocational interests. Similarly, the context of belonginess in this study may function differently from previous studies where it is shown to play a role in students’ academic experiences. Therefore, although the results were not significant, it helps understand future directions needed within research,especially in the realm of recruitment and retention of students in school psychology. As such, future research may focus on the degree of support students perceive from faculty in their program to meet their goals. This would be more relevant to exploring reasons students may choice to remain in the field of school psychology. Black Graduate School Psychology Students’ Perceived Alignment with NASP Domains of Practice In this study, participants were asked about the degree to which they perceived alignment with the ten NASP Domains.To explore Black graduate school psychology students’ responses to this survey, descriptive statistics were analyzed for each item on the survey. The findings showed that the highest perceived alignment is with Domain 8 -Equitable Practices for Diverse Student Populationsacross participants. Previous research has focused on alignment with actual and desired roles across the NASP Domains among practicing school psychologists(Petereit, 2020).It was found that most school psychologists desired to spend most of their time with Domain4 –Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions. However, the current study makes a unique contribution to the scant literature based in the field of school psychology by focusing on graduate students and on Black graduate students who are underrepresented in the profession. These findings are important to understand the values of Black students in school psychology and may help direct the types of supports these students may need or find helpful as they matriculate in their program.Students in specialist school psychology programs generally endorsedfullalignment across each of the ten NASP Domains. However, specialist and doctoral students alike, endorsed the full alignment, specifically, with Domain 4 –Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions, Domain 5 –School Wide Practices to Promote Learning, and Domain 6 -Services to Promote Safe and Supportive Schools. Doctoral school psychology students endorsed a high degree of alignment with Domain 3 –Academic Interventions and Instructional Supports. Overall, the descriptive statistics of alignment with the NASP domains show master’s students as having the low means, indicating poor to moderate alignment. Further, descriptive statistics show that specialist school psychology students endorsed high levels of career choice satisfaction with school psychology.Overall, participants in this study endorsed the highest level of alignment with Domain 8 –Equitable Practices for Diverse Student Populations. However, further exploration revealed that aside from Domain 8, doctoralstudents endorsed the highest levels of alignment with Domain 4–Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions,whereas master’s students endorsed the highest levels of alignment with both Domain 4–Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions and Domain 6 –Services Promote Safe and Supportive Schools.Therefore, doctoral programs seeking to recruit and retain Black students may need to make concerted efforts to highlight the work being done in Domain 8 and Domain 4. Although it is pertinent to recruit more students at the doctorate level to contribute to diversification of faculty, similar efforts should also be made to diversify recruitment within masters school psychology programs. These findings contribute to the literature on graduate school psychology studentsand their views on NASP standards. Also, studies have not differentiated between program types of school psychology students. Given that there are some differences in the training that students receive in these programs, these findings are crucial to program recruitment. Based on NASP (2017),entry level into the profession of school psychology requires a specialist degree, which suggests that although one may have a master’s degreein school psychology, they still may not be eligible to practice without a credential in their state. Theremay be noteworthy experiential or educational differences among school psychology students that are important considerations for recruitment in the field.LimitationsAlthough this study contributes to the literature on Black graduate students in school psychology programs, there are some limitations to be discussed. These limitations include the research design,study, sample size, bias, and participant demographics. Research DesignThe methodological approach used in this study was quantitative in nature. Although items related to demographics allowed the submission of open-ended responses, a mixed-method approach could have strengthened the results of this study. The research that has focused on graduate school psychology students use quantitative approaches and some have primarily utilized qualitative methods.The benefits of quantitative research are noted to be its objectivity as it relates to making observations, measurements, and quantifiable steps to replicate studiesthat generate important empirical information (Creswell, 2014).Because larger sample sizes are typically essential for quantitativemethods, there is also an inclination to deem this research more reliable, valid, and rigorous than qualitative methods (Hanzel, 2011).Yet, there may lack depth in terms of gaining a deeper understanding of individual experiences or social phenomena (Rahman, 2017).Conversely, qualitative research allows participants to share their experiences and enables researchers the opportunity to clarify their shared experiences to produce findings (Creswell, 2007; Rahman, 2017). The data collection and analysisusing qualitative methodsare centered around a holistic approach to explore human behavior,social interactions, and human choice (Choy, 2014). However, the generalizability of findings is concerning. A mixed-method approach to this type of research wouldmitigate the weaknesses of either methodological approach to provide a moredetailed contextualized insights while maintaining some degree of external validity (Creswell, 2014).Another limitation that is important to point out isthat the theoretical bases of this study may not be applicableconsidering the selected sample. More specifically, SCCT may not be as relevant to graduate students whohave, presumably, already decidedto pursue school psychology as a career. The study completed by Bocanegra et al. (2016) focused on applying SCCT to the experiences ofminority undergraduate studentsand their exposure, or lack thereof,to the field of school psychology as viable career choice. Other studies thathave utilizedSCCT as a theoretical foundation have focused on undergraduate students (Byars-Winston & Rogers, 2019; Bocanegra et al., 2016; Muwonge et al., 2017)or those who were still exploring their options for their studies at the college level career (Carrico & Tendhar, 2012).Therefore, it may be important to consider developing surveys specifically for graduate students in particular fields of study, such as school psychology. As previously mentioned, using qualitative methods could also be advantageous to capture more nuanced or contextual information about these students’ experiences.Sample SizeOne of the limitations of the study is the relatively small sample size of the participants. As outlined in the methods section, data were collected online via a self-report survey. Out of the 150 respondents who agreed to participate in the study by selecting “Agree” on the consent form page, 38 did not complete one or more of the instruments in the study. Upon completing a listwise deletion of these cases from the dataset, a final sample of 112 participants remained. Although the power analysis indicated that a sample size of 92would be sufficient to power to detect medium effects, and 112 participants were included in the study, this remains a small number considering the quantitative analyses conducted. Although the study sample allowed the experiences of self-identified Black school psychology students from across theAfrican diaspora to be evaluated, the sample does not allow for subgroup differences or similarities to be examined. It is possible that in a larger sample size, variancecould have been increased, measurement invariance could have been tested across subgroups, andmore significance could have been found among the variables.Additionally, despite persistent recruitment efforts over nearly four months that were allocated for data collection, the study still resulted in a smaller sample size. The smaller sample size, however, could be attributed to the small number of Black-identifying students enrolled in school psychology programs. The number of items within the study could have also shaped the rate of participants’ responses to the survey. The Qualtrics (2022) system estimated that it took about 22 minutes for participants to complete the survey and surveys that take any longer than nine minutes show substantial levels of respondent break-off especially on mobile devices.Considering that there were demographic questions and seven measures embedded in the survey,the length of time it might take to complete the survey could have served as a barrier for some participants(Podsakoff et al., 2003).BiasGiven that the study utilized participantsself-report data, it is important to consider that there may be some bias in their responses to items. Participants of this study not only had a specific or high interest in the topic of the study buthad a genuine desire to share their experiences as well.The recruitment for this study was specifically targeted toward school psychology students so this is expected. Yet, it is important to note that responses may have been different if participants were recruited more broadly. For example, results may have differed if recruitment included students enrolled in any graduate programas opposed to solely school psychology programs.Given the survey-based nature of the study, the halo effect (i.e., a cognitive bias where there is a tendency to form a general impressionbased upon a single factor, Creswell, 2003)and social desirability bias (i.e., biased thoughts and opinionsabout subsequent items in a questionnaire that are based impressions from previous items, Lavrakas, 2008)both could have impacted the results.However, this is typically expectedwithin the context of collecting self-report data.ParticipantsAnother limitation of the study includes demographic information from participants regarding the type of school psychology programs they were enrolled in. The responseoptions fortypes of school psychology programwere: “Doctoral (Psy.D., Ph.D., Ed.D.)”, “Masters(M.A., M.S., M.Ed.)”, “Specialist(Ed.S., M.A., M.S., CAS, CAGS, Psy.S.), or “Other (please specify)”which gave participants the option to provide anopen-ended response.Three of the participants in the study selected “Other (please specify)” and input task value were significant predictors of career choice satisfaction. Further research may seek to directly explore the career goals and aspirations of Black graduate school psychology students. It may also be poignant to pose questions about these students’ perceived barriers in achieving stated career goals and aspirations. Some of the potentialbarriers for Black graduate students’pursuit of school psychology includelimited exposure to the field, limited school psychology faculty, social and economic factors, and microaggressions. The findings of this study indicatethat Black graduate school psychology studentsgenerally endorsed high levels of hope,which align with prior researchwhich show thathope is higher in minority students (Adelabu, 2008; Snyder, 2000). Considering the role of hope as a protective factor(Hirsch, et al., 2012), futureresearch might aim toexploreother protective factorsthat may act against barriersfor Black school psychology graduate students. In positive psychology, it has been found that graduate studentswithgrowth mindsetstake initiative and believe that hard work determine success more than intelligence alone(Hochanadel & Finamore, 2015).Therefore, it would be interesting to explore the mindsets of Black students in school psychology programswhich mightinclude investigatingresilience or even imposter syndrome(Stone et al., 2018). However, it is equally important to add to the literature and explicitly evaluate barriers perceived by current Black graduate school psychology students. A study conducted by Proctor and Truscott (2012)found that attrition of Black studentsin schoolpsychology programs waslinked to misalignment with students’ career goals, perceived job role restraint as it relates to special education placement, and poor relationships with faculty. Another studyfound that Black students in school psychology often seek mentors outside of their school psychology program due to issues with microaggressions or a color-blind ideology from mostly White faculty (Graves et al., 2019).The current study explored hope and belongingness as socio-cultural factors that may serve as barriers or have implications for career choice satisfaction. Yet, the concepts and items used were broader in scope. It may be beneficial to focus specifically on the types of experiences unique to underrepresented students who areenrolled in school psychology programs. Moreover, approaching future research using mixed methodologies that include interviewing, open-ended responses, andmultiple-choice questions mayprovide deeper insights. Relevant questions might include, but not be limited to, the following:•Can you recall when you were first exposed to the field of school psychology?•Why did you decide to pursue school psychology?•Was there a specific instance orperson that inspired you to pursue this career path?•If applicable, what continually motivates you toward completing your school psychology program aside from graduating?•Have you ever experienced a microaggression(s)in your program, at your practicum sites, or during any professional eventrelated to school psychology? •How would you describe mentorship you’ve receivedas it relates to your career goals and aspirations as? Has this mentorship beenfrom faculty in your program?•What type of career/job might you pursue post-graduation? Or in what type of setting might you pursue a career/job?•Based on NASP Domains, in what domain would you prefer to spend most of your time as a school psychologist? Please explain."

Seven participants engaged in a three-phase multi-method study. Data was collected through an initial semi-structured interview, a phase of text message exchanges during the marking period of a CS course, and a final exit interview. Results clustered around four textural themes (challenges, gains, support, and goals) and four structural themes (professors, curriculum, peers, and environment). These themes generated a basic conceptual model suggesting that students engaging with the CS environment experience positive academic adjustment built upon a foundation of psychological thriving.

This dissertation study focuses specifically on increasing the representation of Black school psychologists. Previous literature shows that Black youth have been historically marginalized and discriminated against in the U.S. system of education. Therefore, increasing representation of Black school psychologistsis critically important tobetter serve Black youth.In striving to increase the recruitment and retention of Black school psychologists, this study aims to provide an understanding about the reasons why Black students choose school psychology and whether they are satisfied with their training. Using multiple regression analysis,this studyexaminedself-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task valueas variables predicting career satisfaction among Black graduate school psychology students. Results indicated that outcome expectations and task value were significant predictors of career choice satisfaction. Hope and belongingness did not mediate the relation between self-efficacy, task value outcome expectations, and career choice satisfaction. Exploratory analyses were also conducted on alignment with NASP Domains and observed across doctoral, masters, and specialist students. Implications for research and practice within the field of school psychology are discussed.",

            "output": "The recruitment and retention of ethnically and racially minoritized professionals in school psychology is an important topic. With the rising number of diverse student populations in the U.S. (Goforth et al., 2021), it is critical that continued research and practices in school psychology remain responsive to an inevitable need to increase representation among its service providers. The current study provides insights about the perceptions of Black graduate school psychology students about career choice satisfaction, which is lacking in the literature. Future directions might further explore thesocio-cognitive factors included in this study, such as self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task value. However, it is necessary to continue to expand this branch of research to a more critical lens for understanding how to progress the field forward. Overall, there is a need to address the social, political, and systemic issues that may impede recruitmentor shifts in the paradigm or practices in school psychology. Also, the types of tasks that underrepresented student’svalue and the types of outcomes they aspire toward post-graduation will be meaningful to advance these conversations toward action-oriented steps for improvement. Although the findings of this study can expand the current knowledge about students’ intentions in pursuing school, there iscertainly more work to be done in this regard."

            "tl;dr": "",         
            "abstract": "It  is unclear  how  common  is  change  in  the  severity  of  autism  symptoms during  childhood, whether  symptoms  change  consistentlyacross  development,and  what  characterizes  children that  either  increase  or  decrease  in autism  symptomseverity  during  childhood.  We  evaluated these  questions acrossthree  studies  incorporating  children fromthe  University  of  California, Davis  MIND  Institute’s  Autism  Phenome  Project  and  Girls  with  Autism  imaging  of Neurodevelopment cohorts. Autism symptoms and severity level were evaluated using the ADOS Calibrated Severity Score (CSS). Around half (46%-51%) of the children in the cohort changed in symptom severity levelover  time,  with  the  other  half  remaining  stable. Change  in  symptom severity  was  not  consistent  but  rather  fluctuated  over  time;severity  decreases  were  more common  during  early  childhoodwhileseverity  increases  occurred atboth early  and  middle childhood.Most children experienced change during only one period and remained stable during the other.Social-communication challenges and restricted/repetitive behaviors(RRBs) changeddifferentlyacross   childhood. During   middle   childhood,increase   in social-communication symptomswas especially prominentin parallel toRRBs severity decrease. Being female, having higherand increasingIQ, higher adaptive functioning,and havingolder, more educated parents wereassociated with decrease in symptom severity. Decreasing RRBs severity during middle childhood was associated with higher anxiety and probability forhaving an anxiety disorder at 11yearsof age. Increasing symptom severity was associated with having lower and stable IQ, lower adaptive functioning and not making peer-equivalent gains over time, lower parental education level and younger parental age at the child’s birth.Increasing severity of social-communication challengesduring middle childhood was associated with elevatedand increasing anxiety, ADHD, disruptive behavior problems and overall psychopathology.Symptom severity change patterns were not associated witheither initial severity level at 3-years-of-age orinterventionhistory. We discuss findings in light of theliterature and implications for definingautismseverityleveland suitable interventions.",
