            "output": "The turn of the twentieth century brought about a renewed interest in human prehistory. Throughout the nineteenth century, major archaeological discoveries were uncovered; among the most well-known discoveries are the investigations of Monte Albán in southern Mexico from 1859 onward, the numerous cave paintings and rock art found in Europe and Central America, and the first hominid fossils found in 1891. Great minds like Charles Darwin spurred the conversation forward by claiming, among other arguments, that humankind originated in Africa; the fact that the first hominid was found in Asia sparked a debate against Darwin’s claim. On top of these discoveries was the continuing fascination for previous cultures, like that of ancient Egyptian and ancient Greco-Roman peoples. Consequently, the formation of human history became a widely discussed topic for scholars and the educated public in the mid to late nineteenth century. And though this interest diminished following the outbreak of two great wars, it was rekindled again with the discovery of the cave art in the famous Lascaux Cave in France in 1940, as well as other caves in the Dordogne department of southwestern France. We continue to uncover new discoveries today, shattering older perceptions of the prehistoric timeline and shifting our previous knowledge of the time before written history. Though many of the more well-known caves are now closed in an effort to preserve the art, the less popular caves are still open to the general public. Because of the mystery surrounding it, prehistoric art remains a popular subject of debate between theorists, historians, scientists, and philosophers alike. Among those who visit the caves are also artists. As art and artifacts were uncovered in caves across Western Europe, the disciplines of art history and archaeology were connected more than they ever had been. Archaeologists used art historical terms to define the prehistoric art they found, and art historians acknowledged prehistoric art as the beginning of art history. But despite this acknowledgment, art historians neglected to change the overall story of art history in regard to its beginnings. However, this has not stopped people from connecting prehistoric art with modern motifs in art. Pablo Picasso, for example, claimed to have never drawn inspiration from prehistoric art, yet people still draw connections between his “primitive” style and the prehistoric depictions of animals and humans on cave walls. These ideas have melded into popular culture; even if a person has not visited one of the many caves with evidence of prehistoric humans across the globe, they will no doubt be familiar with the caveman concept from cartoons like The Flintstones, comic strips like “B.C.” (Figure 1), or even alien conspiracy theories (like the “ancient astronauts” hypothesis). Although there is no documented correlation between Picasso’s work and prehistoric art, other Western Modern artists did acknowledge their direct inspiration from cave art. When she entered one of the many prehistoric caves in the southwest of France in 1983, Elaine de Kooning found an unexpected theme for her next series, which she named Cave Walls. Through analyzing the direct connection between Elaine de Kooning’s Cave Walls series and the prehistoric art found in Europe, I intend to argue for the significant effect that prehistoric art had on several Western Modern artists in the latter half of the twentieth century. Culling from examples in Contemporary Art, I will explain that this interest in prehistoric art does not reveal itself in a singular artist but within entire communities of artists. With this in mind, I will lay out evidence of how prehistoric art has become regarded as an afterthought in the larger field of art history, and I intend to demonstrate that prehistoric art is not an afterthought but a continuous, collective memory in the minds of today’s society, shaping the way we view the world."

Through these market programs detailedknowledge of NativeAmerican life is portrayed. NativeAmerican art markets are both educational and economical tools by promoting cultural persistence for NativeAmerican communities. In this thesisIwill attempt to disclose the evolution, growth and purposeofNativeAmerican art markets.The first major NativeAmerican art marketin the United States was createdin the Southwest.In 1921 Museum of New Mexico directorsEdgar Lee Hewett and Kenneth Chapman established the Indian Fairin Santa Fe, New Mexico and thefollowing yearit officially opened to the public. After years of changetheSouthwest Indian Faircontinuedinto the twenty-first century as the well-knownSanta Fe Indian Market. For decades the market would pavethe way for other Nativeinspiredinstitutions to develop their ownmarketprograms. Today,the city of Santa Feseesa significant boost in the economy during the market weekend. Leading in innovation,the Santa Fe Indian Marketcontinues to influence the development of other art markets. The Autry National Center of Los Angeles is one such museumthatadapted aNativeart market program. According to theirwebsite, the marketplaceserves as “the largest NativeAmerican arts fair in Southern California, the Autry'sAmerican Indian Arts Marketplacefeatures 200 NativeAmerican artistswho represent more than 40 tribes.”4When Los Angeles’ diverse Nativepopulation was formed byenriched United States government-run Relocation programs of the 1950’s, thecity became one of severalurban centerschosen to assimilateAmerican Indian familiesintomainstream America. Today, Los Angeles ishome to many Nativegroups from acrossthe United Statesas well as their own indigenous populations such as the Gabrielino-Tongva tribe.NativeAmericans that movedto Los Angelesduring this erastrengthened their inter-tribal relations and resisted assimilation. The Autry National Center is aspacewhereSouthern California tribesconnectand gather and witness the rich diversity in Southern California Nativegroupsduring the its annual marketplace. The Autry American Indian Arts Marketplace supports collaboration between institution and local Natives to provide educational and economic opportunitiesfor those involved. The Eiteljorg Museum ofAmerican Indian and Southwestern Artin Indianapolis, Indianais an example of a Nativeart marketthrivingoutside the Southwest. This Midwest institution is helping visitorstoreconsiderthe present perceptions and stereotypes of NativeAmericanstaught by the United States educational system. The Eiteljorg Indian Market and Festivalserves the community by educating on the diversity and tenacity ofNativeAmericancultures.The market programallows the Eiteljorg to meetnew artistsand donors who will in turn support the museum financially. A CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY OF NATIVE AMERICAN ART MARKETSNativeAmerican art markets beganin Santa Fe, New Mexicoat the endof the nineteenth century. American Indian museumscholarsKathleen Howard and Diana Pardue credit the creation of the transcontinental railwaysystem forthe emergence of Nativearts. According to the duo, “New Mexico’s population tripled between 1880 and 1920.”5Railroadsentering New Mexicoexposed travelerstoNativeAmerican cultures. Bruce Bernstein, former Director of the Southwest Association of Indian Artselaborates:“The trains also brought tourists, whose fear of frontier land began to give away to curiosity. Anglo-American traders took advantage of this situation to sellNativemade curios to visitors.”6He also suggests, “traders encouraged Indian artists to make pottery and other items expressly for outsiders. Across the Southwest, Nativevendors positioned themselves at railway stations selling souvenirs to tourists.”7Throughthe railwayexperiencemore tourists discovered NativeAmerican aesthetics.Formed in Topeka Kansas in 1876,The Fred Harvey Company, a railway food service organization,opened business along railroad stops in New Mexico’s PuebloIndianvillages. The companycapitalized on their captive clientele bycommercializingNativeAmerican art. Touristsbegan to purchase low cost souvenirs from Nativeartists.Therailroadhad broughtwith itameans togenerateincome forSouthwestern Nativegroups. According to Howard and Pardue, “NativeAmericans were faced with the need to participate in the cash economy prevalent within the Euro-American population.”8Touristswere attracted to the Indian“exotic” cultureand began to purchase Nativeartworks for personal collection.In return theseart sales introduced NativeAmericans to a cash based economy. Meanwhile,acrossthecountrypopularnationalfairsweretakingplacesuchastheChicagoWorldFair(1893)andthePanama-CaliforniaExposition(1915-1917).ThesecelebrationsalsointroducedthemodernNativeAmericantothepublic.OpinionsonAmericanIndianswereshiftingfromthe“savageIndian”toamorefascinatingperception.TheallureofNativeAmericancultureseenatthesefairswasnoticed;touristswouldvisittheSouthwesttoseekadventure.TheywouldcommemoratetheirexperienceintheSouthwestbytakinghomeNativeAmericanhand-madecurios.Fromworldfairsandthenewlyintegratedrailwaysystem,theSouthwestbecamethecenterpointofNativeAmericanarts.Also during this time itbecame difficult for NativeAmericans to devote energyinto art production. Because of economic hardship timewasspent working laborious full-time jobs rather thancreating art for leisure. Anglo-American anthropologist Edgar Hewettrealized that the low cost Nativesouvenirs sold at railway stations were not giving proper credit to the inherent artistic talentof NativeAmericans. Hewett andhiscolleagueswanted to gain awareness for American Indian arts on a national level while preserving traditional Nativeart methods. In1909the Museum of New Mexico was founded. Bernstein discusses the reasoning behind the formation of theirfirst Indian fair. According to Bernsteinthese benefactors“began to encouragepotters to make pottery modeledon prehistoric and historic pieces that were thought to represent an unsullied or authentic culture.”9The purpose of the market was to safeguard traditional techniques that made quality Native art so special. Hewett and colleaguesthenset thestageduring the 1920’s for SouthwestIndians to produceNativearts to be preserved, admiredand soldat art markets.In 1925 Mary Austin, anotherAnglo-American Nativearts advocate,formedthe Indian Arts Fund(IAF). According to historians Carter Jones Meyer and Diana Royer, “Austin believed that every effort was needed to protect Nativeart. To do so would not only lead to the resurrection of the handicraft culture threatened by the machine age, but also a renewed interest in the environment as a focal point of American life.”10The Indian Arts Fundstrovetorenew a sense of accomplishmentamong Indiansin practicingNativeartistry. Programs like thisand the annual Indian Fair were soon demonstrating their economical rewardtorelevantartists and the city of Santa Fe. "

            "output": "In an essay for Artforum’s fiftieth anniversary issue in 2012, scholar Claire Bishop posits: “Whatever happened to digital art?”1Despite the backlash that Bishop received after her essay was published, this leadingquestion and its ensuingcontroversy are very much present in the world of contemporary art, which has institutions and galleries dedicated to only it and its postmodernity (or lack thereof). However, I do not feel that something has happened to digital art, but rather, digital art has been oft-separated from the rest of the so-called fine arts. Shortly after her initial question, Bishop wonders why digital works have not thoroughly “[filtered] affect through the digital,” and with this remark, I firmly believe digital works, or artworks built with the technological, fully utilize affect with the apparatus and especially so in the institutional space.The most pertinentpart of Bishop’s argument isthe prescribed backlash inits aftermath. Curator Lauren Cornell co-penned a response to the essay with Brian Droitcour, relaying that Bishop’s initial question was inherently flawed due to the author’s general disinterest in the digital,as well as a focus—perhaps due to her position as an art historian—on mainstream contemporary art, or the kind of art that is known to valuethe material and tactileover the immaterial. It was an impassioned plea for new media, and the kind of response that elicited further dialoguefrom Bishop. Cornell and Ed Halter’s anthologyMass Effect: Art and the Internet in the Twenty-First Centurycontains Bishop’s original essay “Digital Divide” as well as a follow-up essay commissioned by the volume’s editors titled “Sweeping, Dumb, and Aggressively Ignorant!Revisiting ‘Digital Divide’”.2Aside from “digital divide” as a way of demarcating those who have access to technology and those who do not and framing it as a race and class-based issue, Bishop’s digital divide takes place solely in the realm of art; perhaps situating it as a specifically art-based issue is its biggest problem.  It is not as cut-and-dry as whether or not new media art does x, y, or z like its analog predecessors, but moreso about the nuances that make it seem so unapproachable or uninteresting to those, like Bishop,committed to the so-called canon of art historical importance that privileges a very specific notion of form and technicality accomplished by pen or brush to canvas. Code—whether painstakingly composedby its author or manipulated through a program—asks for new ways of feeling through occupying digital space,and allows for an alternative replication of emotion and feeling that is typically accessedthrough figures, or occasionally the lack thereof, in modern and postmodern art practice.However,in many instances,interacting with a work that utilizes digital media in anycapacity beseeches the viewer to stay with it for a duration of time; a digital painting might elicit doubt that it was painted using a brush and not a tablet, for example. While largely placing the blame on the editors at Artforum, Bishop admitted that she chose to trade an emphasis on the specter of technology that looms over works of art produced after 1989 for the idea that new media art was part of a “niche (like many others) with its own star system, discourse, and structures of dissemination.”4Although the following sections touch uponthe shortcomingsofBishop’s initial argument, my interest in the sensuality of new media and its presentation in digital and physical spaces is explicated in a tripartite thematic division prompted by my thesis project. Naturally,reflecting upon the exhibition that took place in January of 2018, as well expanding upon the underlying concepts that formed and shaped it,is important for my curatorial practice. Beginningwith this exhibition, whichincludedthree artists with differing practices who allusethe Internet and digital media to inform their works, as a case study, my initial thesis that a form of emotional labor takes place when interacting with the network (the network as it underlines and shapes the Internet)—especially as a woman—inspiredmore rhetorical questions than actual answers or conclusions. This is another theme of the followingtext: Being that the nature of acuratorial practice has become more of an exploration of the unknowable, the unanswerable; many of my own thoughts concerning the research I have been doing have cropped up in the form of fragments or vignettes, yet I have come upon a general ideaof the most pertinent thematic inquiries to continue pursuing in the future. For instance, the Internet’s relationship with the networkhasproduced countless artworks that either respond to that relationship or treat it purely as a medium or an arbitrary means of reaching another conclusion. I initially leaned on Alexander Galloway’s definition of the network from the anthologyCritical Terms for Media Studies(his definition of the network has varied largely from this particular example)to further devisewhat the network—and the Internet—even is as a concept; he likened it metaphorically to chaos and ruin.5As poetic as this is, I later found Tiziana Terranova to have a much more nuanced idea of the interrelationship between the networks and the Internet, speaking to it as:[...] a network of networks, or an internetwork, a topological formation that presents some challenging insights into the dynamics underlying the formation of a global network culture. As a technical system, the Internet consists of a set of interrelated protocols, abstract technical diagrams that give the network consistency beyond the rapidly changing hardware environment of computers, servers, cable and wires.6This confluence of the two concepts speaks to information and communication; Terranova does not specifically speak to art practice, but it rightly figures into the exchanges of creativity between bodies. Encountering another body online through language or image is incredibly unique to the Internet, allowing us akind of freedom to express emotions through the likes of code, messaging services, and blogging, among others. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun recently posited that new media is under constant renovation; the interconnectedness of the Internet, and in turn, the network, does not quite promote collectivity among its users, instead opting for an emphasis on the individual. She creates a more-relevant term for new media, writing: “The NOW constantly punctures time, as the new quickly becomes old, and the old becomes forwarded once more as new(ish). New media are N(YOU) media; new media are a function of YOU.”7It is possible that this theorization of new media as a subjective media transcends the tendency of art theory and criticism to “other”art discourses that appear to be broad or even generally hard to define. Seth Price’s Dispersion takes the form of a hybridized theory-practice artwork that is hard to categorize, and upon further review, what makes new media so exciting as a means to situate works that underline interdisciplinary methods.It is an essay rooted in art historythat pertinently speaks to new media as a constant cycling-through of the old and the new, yet it is crystalized permanently online as a PDFthat was originally designed in Adobe InDesign.Price’s conversation regarding distributed media mirrors the ongoing conversation around distributed networks akin to Terranova and Chun’s, and the project’s execution as an essay (that employs language in the form of vignettes)utilizes language to speak to media—in whichever way it records and is recorded—and its ability to be a “mode of production analogous not to the creation of material goods, but to the production of social contexts.”8Although Dispersionexists as a booklet and was physically integratedin Price’s exhibition at Reena Spaulings Fine Art,its context within and around conceptual art directly feeds into the malleabilityallowed by new media works and, in its initial execution, prompts the following discussion aroundelements of new media artworks."

            "output": "Information on Native American art markets was obtained through library research, observation and interviews. The investigation compared and contrasted approaches oftwo NativeAmerican art market programs. This thesis also served as a comparative study on the effect these programs have on Native artists and their communities as well as institution and their local communities. Before delving into the observations the reader must learn about the history of Native American art, its rise to commercialization and the impact art markets have on economical and educational efforts surrounding Indian country. I found historical document through library research. Thisincluded visiting the Southwest Braun Research library and the American Indian Studies Center libraryof Los Angeles. With help from Librarian Kenneth Wade, I was able to locate the works of leading Nativeart market scholars such as Bruce Bernstein, Molly Mullins and Nancy Parezo.  As for historical research,I conducteda background inquiry into the Autry National Center and the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Artand Southwestern Association of Indian Arts.Without historical context it isdifficult to pinpoint the correlation between the emergence of Native American art and the art market venue. Three observationswere made during this study. Using the Santa Fe Indian Market as a precedent, I then compared and contrasted the Eiteljorg Indian Market and Festival to the Autry American Indian Arts Marketplace.  I visitedeachinstitution during itsannual artsmarket to gain inside perspective, personalexperience and understanding oftheoperation. Itraveled cross-country to witness for myself the dynamics of a Native American art market. June 2014 brought me home to visit the EiteljorgMuseum in Indianapolis, Indiana,where in 2010 I served as the Market and Festival intern. That same year I took a weekend road tripin August to the Santa Fe Indian Market from Los Angeles to New Mexico. A few months later, inNovember,I made the brief commute across town to the Autry Museum American Indian Arts Marketplace. Anthropological research methods expert Russell Bernard notes that“direct observations provides much more accurate results about behavior that do reports of behavior.”2In this case, direct observation was vital, as little reports have beenmade about the Autry and Eiteljorgmarket programs. The research was carried out in the participant observerperspective. No preconceived notions or biases wereconsidered in drawing conclusions. On sight, new acquaintances were met with a greeting and introduction to the project. Contact information was collected from participants to avoid interrupting thesales process of the artists as informal interviews wereconductedvia email at a later time. These methods contributed to open-ended conversation and allowed time to develop personalized questions. Questions were thentailored to each specific artistkeeping in mind that they could befrom a different tribe, location and have different art mediums. Email waslatersent so the intervieweewould have time to ponder eachquestion and answer more in depth.The rise in the use of technology to collect informationallowed me to carry out the one-on-one interviews online. According to Anthropologist Russell Bernard, “computers-as-interviewers are fine when the questions are clear and people don’t needa lot of extra information.”3Networking and interviewing off-site worked best for this specific research.  Staff interviews were acquiredfrom each institutionwith those thatwork directly with artists in the year round planning of the event. Lisa Watt, former Festivals and Markets Coordinator at the Eiteljorg, is a personal friend. Lisa also reached out to the connections she made as coordinator via social media to find participants for the research. Her connectionseventually provided me with two more artistswilling to participate. Patty Carmack, Artist Relations at the Autry,agreed to interview after reaching out to her via email. Carmackwas willing to meet over coffee for a face-to-face interview. We stayed connected after the meeting by email as she assisted me in specific questions on the Autry marketplace throughout the writing process. Formal meetings were set at the museumswithDr. Rick West,Director of the Autry National Centerand John Vanausdall, Director of the Eiteljorg Museum,to obtain the institutional standpoint on eachmarket. Mixed interview methods were utilized to meet individual schedule and preference. With the viewpoint and experience of the staffthe researchcould also investigate changes and improvements made in the market between 2008-2014. This aided in measuring the growth, success rate and economic and educational impacteach market observed. In recent decades Native American art markets haveexpanded out of the Southwest and into  more  metropolitan  areas  across  the  United  States.  Scholarship  onNativeAmerican  art marketsincludes  that  of  Southwestern  Association  of  Indian  Arts  ExecutiveDirector  Bruce Bernstein’s  (2012), Santa  Fe  Indian  MarketandanthropologistMolly  H.  Mullins(2001), Culture  in  the  Marketplace.  Few  have  considered  Native  American  art  markets  outside  of  the Southwest. This study will reach further, expanding into the Great Lakes region to shed light on the developmentof Native American art markets."

            "output": " Though Elaine de Kooning, Pierre Soulages, and various digital and street artists focus on cave paintings found in western Europe, there are other Modern and Contemporary artists who draw inspiration from different prehistoric cultures. Chinese artist Han Meilin has had his reinterpretations of Chinese rock art exhibited in the Yinchuan World Rock Art Museum. American artist and rock art researcher Elanie Moore finds inspiration in rock art from Mexico and practices prehistoric artistic techniques in her paintings. The fascination with prehistoric art stretches beyond the popular images from Lascaux and Altamira. Prehistoric art is quickly becoming a global phenomenon, spurring artists to take inspiration from their ancestors and reimagine the modern world. And perhaps this is only a passing fashion. Perhaps this fascination ends sooner rather than later. That does not make this prehistoric renaissance any less valid for both the artists and the study of art history. The Fauvist movement, for example, was a short-lived period of art (approximately from 1904 to 1910) that was practiced by a small group of Western artists, and yet it holds an important place in art history textbooks as an extension of Impressionism and a precursor to Expressionism. The Cubist movement only lasted for about seven years, and yet students are taught that without Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, movements such as Futurism, Dada, and De Stijl might have never developed. Art history students are consistently taught the importance of connections between cultures, histories, and movements. We are taught that without the ingenuity of the past, we would not have the development of the future. Because of this neo-prehistoric art movement that we find ourselves within, now is the ideal time to revolutionize the way we learn about art history. It is time to rewrite the textbooks to emphasize the art historical and cultural relevance of prehistoric art in a modern and contemporary art context. As de Kooning impresses upon in her first encounters with prehistoric art, the concepts of past and present become null. Time ceases to exist. Yet within art historical studies, the notions of “before common era” and “common era” encourage separation between past and present, and it subsequently establishes a disconnect. But how can we call ourselves true art historians if we only consider certain parts of art history when analyzing present trends in art? The fundamental definition of the study of history is that it is an investigative discipline that seeks to understand events of the past and analyze the causes and effects of these past events. As of today, the discipline of art history widely neglects the effects of prehistoric artistic behaviors. Maybe this is because the circumstances of prehistoric art are speculative – everything is based in theory, everything is up for personal interpretation. But isn’t that what art history is all about?"

            "output": "Throughhistorical background,interviewsand direct observation the researchuncoveredsimilarities anddifferences between the Autry and Eiteljorg museumart market programs.Both programs started in 1991and have continued to grow into an important developmental tool. But it is what the art market does for the institutions themselves that keep itasan important part of their programming. The art markets are not making these institutions a great deal of money.What they are achievingin is satisfying education missions and increasing networking with Nativeartists and donors. Through this observation it becomes clear that American Indian art markets are utilized as institutional developmental toolssupporting their growth into the future. Itis difficult to say that every local economy benefits from a Native American art market. The Santa Fe Indian Market is a largefactor in the New Mexico and Santa Fe economy because of the sheer size of the event. It takes over everything duringmarket week. The Eiteljorg and Autrymarketsare harder tomeasure because theirsizes are much smaller. Although the local economy may not be as greatly influenced as Santa Fe, the Eiteljorg and Autry are well aware of the educational impact it has on the local economy. Many of the positive impactsconcluded from this research onNative American art markets are intangible. For example, for many decades prior to Native art markets NativeAmerican art was considered “primitive” or a craft and not specialized.  NativeAmericans as a group held no power in anything social, economical and political until some specific tribes were granted federal recognition and now hold the opportunity to sovereignty.  Today, with the institutional development of programming such art markets,innovation in NativeAmerican art is supported. The development of NativeAmerican art markets creates a platform for Nativeartists to express personal identities through art.With art markets, artists can network,builda following of patrons, cultivate a supportiveaudience, make money, educate non-Natives and gain admiration and respectas a fine artist.Native American art markets have helped define Native American art as a genre. There are many instancesin theearlyhistory of Native American art marketswhere contemporary Nativeart wasexcluded for being too experimental. “As early as 1924 the Santa Fe Fiesta (Indian Market) separated the innovative artfrom traditional. Buyers would pay more for an older pot than a newer piece. The older piece came from the past, a time when buyers believed all pottery was more authentic andmade for home use. Older pots were thought to be more pure or more Indian.”76This has changed since the adoption of the art market as a venue of quality and standards. Native art has evolved to hold more defined stylistic categories as the art market serves as its space of formalization.Many positive impacts were determined from observing Nativeart markets. As for the patrons and collectors, they too benefited from the development of a formalized market venue. One exampleof patron gain is the appraisal classes. The SouthwestIntertribalMarketplace offereda program for visitors to bringin their current collection to be assessed by professional art appraisers. Collectors also benefited with the ease of purchasing art from an assessablemarketsetting. They are guaranteed authenticity and conveniencewhen acquiring artfrom a condensed group of talented Native artists. Authenticity in American Indian art is acurrent and ongoing debate drawing issuesbetween merchants and their consumers.According to scholars Tressa Berman and Lea S. McChesney,“much of the tension in the art-artifact debate that surrounded the institutionalization of traditional NativeAmerican art centered on the question of ‘authenticity’and the relationship of Indigenous objects to a tradition definedas separate from western civilization and its artistic tradition.”77Western ideology has determined that without “authenticity” in indigenous art it cannot be valued. Museum curators, scholars, academia and art dealers all debate what makes an art piece “authentic”, “quality”that is worth collecting.This idea can be contested and refigured but what we do know is that purchasing at a Native art market allows the visitor to personally determine its “authenticity”. NativeAmerican art markets are gatherings of the most talented NativeAmerican artists. Collectors spend a substantialamountto receive authentic Nativeart and can rest easy when purchasing at a credited art market venue. Consumers at the Autry Marketplace and Eiteljorg Market and Festival hold opportunity to purchasedirectly from the artists and learn about theinspiration behind the art. Native American art markets allow visitors to view artwork from up and coming artists that create subjects of contemporary Nativelife. The audience at these art markets absorbs the subjects and themes depicted in NativeAmerican art. In turn a well-informed citizen emerges. Informing the public gains support in the legal and federal arena, such as lobbying, federal recognition, funding for revitalization projects, healthcare, youth and higher education and much more.  There is a correlation between the educational outreach in Nativeartmarkets and the well being of Nativecommunities.For visitors and patrons, the markets provide a relaxed social setting to learn about Native America while acquiring art. For artists there is economic factor, “Art production has given Indian men and women an edge against poverty –a way to obtain cash and maintain economic flexibility, while living on the margins of expanding industrial, post-industrial, and now service economies.”78Art markets promote socio-economic prosperity for Native artists and their communities. As for institutions the art market program is aiding in fulfillment of their educational missions. Native American art markets positively influence both Native and non-Native communities, Native artists and participating institutions. Artists benefit from the obvious economic impact from art markets but alsoinless obviousways. They are able to educate non-Natives on Native life. Contemporary NativeAmericanartists who participatein the art marketssuch as Roger Perkinsand Peter Boomecreate art thatis intertwined with stories that depict traditionalvaluesand beliefs. Nativeart communicatesto its viewer. According to Mithlo, “Good Indian art is the art that successfully conveys the unique cultural experiences of indigenouslife in America.”79This story can be that of the past or modern Indian.  As educators, artists communicate Native knowledge. Art markets also allow artists to communicate with the public but also to network with clientele, patrons and critics that could help their career. Native American art markets benefit artists economically, professionally, and socially. Lastly, art markets have positively influenced the future of the hosting institutions. Each museum observed uses Native art markets to reach contemporary artists. These artists one day could produce the artwork that will fill the gallery walls. This artwork will continue to communicate the Native American story. Institutions also use the art market as a way to meet new patrons and donors and stay connected with old ones.  Besides the social aspects, annual Native art markets are allowing each institution to make an extensive educational impact on the community. Institutions such as the Autry and Eiteljorg museums are advancing from these art market programs. NativeAmerican art markets are expanding and thriving in the twenty-firstcentury.This thesis has explored NativeAmerican artprograms of the Autry and Eiteljorgmuseums. These markets have been proven to build networks between institutions, artists and patrons. The research has supported the obligation of collaboration between artist, Nativecommunities and institution. Each position holds a vital role in educating non-Nativeson Indian life. Through the compilation of personal interviews, research and observation at these art markets the researchwas compared and contrasted. It attempted to uncover the success and growth of NativeAmerican art and the art market in the past century. Most importantly this thesis examined how these art markets support artists, community and institutions. Native American artistsare using art markets to display theirinherent artistic abilities andprosper economically. Art markets promoteself-determinationthatwill allow artists to define themselves as artists. NativeAmericans can use the art market as a tool to survive economically. They alsohave chance to practiceaesthetic traditionswhile participating. Art markets bring convenience in learning about new cultures to the local community. The institutions are able to develop strong relationships for the future while fulfilling their educational mission. The positive educational and economical impact of Native art markets will continue to support the next generation of Native artists and avid admirers. I hope the research provided to you as the reader has enforced my argument and conclusions."

            "output": "While materialism, community, and the archive have been used to re-inscribe and re-characterize new media works through the scope of the art institution, they have also thematically characterized the Internet itself as a relevant artistic tool that is constantly reimagining the future of art practice. Curatorial practice functions as a site,of sorts,akin to the Internet; it tries to renegotiate the role of the institution(in this specific reference, the white cube)in favoring or decrying vast swaths of artworks which very well funnel into the art market itself. According to Boris Groys: [...] every curatorial project has the goal of contradicting the previous, traditional art-historical narratives. If such a contradiction does not take place, the curatorial project loses its legitimacy. An individually curated exhibition that merely reproduces and illustrates the already known narratives simply does not make any sense.49I agree with thisstatement;however, exhibitions continue to function within the realm of the “already known,” further continuing the legacy of the art institution as merely supplementaryto the depths of art practices, and my investigation of the waysnew media has been working against this legacy through its material and experiential makeup is,and will be,a continuing research project. Is it possible that acquiescing to the inevitability of the Internet as a crucial part of curatorial and artistic practice within and around the institution could inspire more interesting future projects? LaTurbo Avedon, an artist whopurports to exist solelyas a nonbinary avatar online, has curatedthe online project Panther Modern—a constantly-evolving architectural mock-up of a structure that will never exist in the real world—since 2013.Avedon encourages artists to inhabit a proposed three-dimensional space that canadd on to this speculative institutional space.50As of this writing, the site houses sixteen unique artist’s projects as “rooms,” which range from interactive (likeannotated YouTubecontent) to scrollable images. Avedon’s project, though currently on hold, imagines the institution as a completely habitable website, assuming that the domain name is renewed promptly and the serverfunctions properly.The body—the self—is “multiple, fluid, and constituted in interaction with machine connections; it is made and transformed by language [...].”51It allows artists like Avedon to retain relative anonymity while conducting ambitious products with likeminded artists. It feels and reacts to works online and offline, but more-so when in control of driving the narrative forward. I click the arrow to go back to a prior page when I think I have “killed” the already-doomed Mouchette; being confronted with the responses of the users who had gone through this trajectory already, responding to her morose questions, makesme question if what I seeon the screen is final (even if she is not a “real” girl). Digital and networked projectsthat operate under Manovich’s baselinedefinition of what constitutes new media artelicit this strange otherworldly empathy through tactility; it is possible that these works possessa form ofBarthes’ punctum, that instinctual detail that establishes a connection with the viewer. I believe this it is still necessary for the punctum to remain a possibility in the physical institutional space, with its promise of forming a relationshipbetween the bodies within itsaudience and the implied intimate relationship betweenthe body and the computer."
