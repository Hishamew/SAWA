            "output": "1.1 Multicomponent alloysTraditional thought of researches on novel materials mainly obeys rules with combination of specific properties comingfrom different component. The mean goal of developing multicomponent alloys is to achieve balance of engineering properties attributedtodifferent components. Conventional alloyingstrategies of one or two components materials were first discovered by Cantor[25].Besides, materials with several components (three or four) can be described through ternary and quaternary phase diagram[27].1.2 High entropy alloys High-entropy alloys, which are regarded as alloys consistingof five or more elementsequallyor  near  equally,  were  first  discovered  back  in  1980s.  Related theories were further developed by Jien-Wei Yeh in 1990s. The very first fabricated HEA alloy is CrMnFeCoNi alloy, which is also known as “Cantor” alloy. Upon the previous researches, many other high-performance alloys tend to form intermetallic compounds which are undesired in terms of mechanical properties due to its negative influence of distribution of phasessuch as low stability based on Gibbs phase rule. Base on Gibbs phase rule, the increasing of instability of the system is corresponding to the growing number of phases. The equiatomic HEAs have been extensively investigated, therefore, more and more emphasis has been put on the study of non-equiatomic HEAs. The HEAs are mainly divided into two divisions in respect of different matrix phase, composed of BCC and FCC. Significantly more researches have been done on FCC-based HEAs than BCC-based HEAs.Besidesmany high entropy alloys  possess strong temperaturedependence mechanical  behavior. For instance, the FCC Cantor alloy exhibits anincreasing yield strength as temperature decreases at rangesbetween 77 to 500K[8]. In contrast to FCC-based HEAs, much less information and details wasobtainedfor BCC-based HEAs. 1.2.1 Core mechanism of HEA1.2.1.1 Lattice distortionRegularly, atoms should be periodically presenting in a unit cell, in other word, certain atom will locate at specific sites. Whereas, in some special cases, atoms may present atsome unexpected sites. In multiple component alloys, distinct atomic size can generate strain and strain energy. The extent of lattice distortion is closely related to atomic radius difference and Poisson’s ratio 𝜈of materials. In terms of characterization, lattice distortion effect will weaken intensity peaksin XRD due to smaller value of structure factor F. In other aspect of properties, the solid solution hardening is enhanced.1.2.1.2 Sluggish diffusion effectSluggishdiffusioneffect of HEA can be simplified through analysis of binary system instead of quinary system. In comparison with pure metal and stainless steel, diffusion rate in HEA is way slower. Diffusion in materials are strongly dependent required energy to propel migration of atomsdislocations, vacancies and so on.This effect  can  be  manipulated  through  adding  certain  component.  For  example,  the addition  of  Ni  can  greatly  enhance  this  effect  by  generating  higher  activation energies for atom migration.1.2.1.3 High entropy effectThermodynamic properties are closely related to Gibbs energy, enthalpyand entropy. Their relation can be expressed by following equation: G=H-TS. In respect of HEA, this relation can be described in other way: 𝛥𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑥=𝛥𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑥−𝑇𝛥𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑥, where 𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑥 , 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑥and 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑥indicates mixing free energy, mixing enthalpy and mixing  entropy  respectively. 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑥is  strongly  corresponding  to  atomic  size variation. All component in HEA have similar enthalpy which propel a smaller 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑥. The  mixing  entropy  of 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑥can  be  established  through  calculation 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑥=𝑅∑𝑥𝑖𝑙𝑛𝑥𝑖𝑛′1, where R and 𝑥𝑖indicates gas constant and atomic ratio respectively. Therefore, due to increasing mixing entropy along with rising number of elements of equimolar alloys, HEA is more stable due to its lower 𝛥𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑥[27].1.2.1.4 Cocktail effectCocktail effect indicates that in HEA with multiple metallic components, the mechanical properties of HEA can easily adjusted by changing composition of one single element. This effect was first discovered by Ranganathan[28].This effect can also be represented by changing the composition of boron in NCATB HEA. For instance, in NCATB HEA, an addition of slim amount (0.05 at%) of boron will propel the formation of Ta2B compound which greatly suppresses 𝛽−𝑁𝑖𝐴𝑙grain boundary precipitates and enhances the ductility."

            "output": "Thereis martensitic transformation occurs in NCATB HEA, more specifically, 𝛾→𝛼′transformation.  This  phenomenon  associates  with  high  strain  rate  with relatively small strain level.(2) During the compression, there is no sign of formation of εmartensite. Higher stability of matrix phase contributes a higher stacking fault energy which causes the absence of εmartensite. At small strain level, high strain rate would be beneficial to nucleation of 𝛼′.(3) Under high strain rate, material behaves with higher yield stress which make it available to surpass the critical for phase transformation. This associates with the strain rate effect on martensitic transformation of NCATB HEA.(4) The precipitate mechanism of NCATB HEA is strongly dependent on the addition of different chemical component.The solid solution phase NiAl3-γ′is a coherent phase with matrix austenite phasewhen precipitate size is under critical value.The size of precipitatesunder 600°C/24h is significantly lower than its critical value which maintains phase coherency.It strengthens the material through increasing required drive force to move dislocation. (5)Grain boundaries precipitates 𝛽−𝑁𝑖𝐴𝑙is observed in NCATB HEA, whose formation can be suppressed by the addition of B.(6) Microbands were observed in specimen. α′martensite seems more favorable to form around microbands."
