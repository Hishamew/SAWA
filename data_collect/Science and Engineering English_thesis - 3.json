            "output": "Engineering is a global profession.  Current and future engineers will need to work together to combat global climate change, consider the sustainable development of less-developed regionsof the world, and even explore space (Grandin & Hirleman, 2009).  Additionally, the outsourcing of jobs and global sales may require that engineers be called upon to move abroad.  To succeed, engineers must feel comfortable in cultures other than their own.   Despite the global nature of the profession, engineers in America have been characterized as lacking vital cross-cultural skills (Blumenthal & Grothus, 2009; Jesiek, Zhu, Woo, Thompson, & Mazzurco, 2014).  University preparation in global competency is limited: incorporating such preparation into the undergraduate engineering curriculum is difficult due to the highly structured curriculum and sequential coursework.  The challenge of giving undergraduate engineers a global experience is reflected in the number of engineering majors nationally who study abroad: less than 5% of all undergraduates who studied abroad in the 2013-2014 school year were engineering majors (IIE, 2015a).  In order to increase participation, some universities have begun to create global engineering programs that will prepare undergraduate engineers for global work.  These programs include coursework in global issues, increased opportunities for international interaction on campus, and enhancement of study abroad opportunities specifically for engineers. This study sought to explore one aspect of global engineering education: study abroad.  The rationale for engineering majors to go abroad is clear: Allan E. Goodman, President and CEOof the Institute for International Education(IIE), notes that “innovation and job growth require individuals to possess the capacity to think and act on a global basis, and ... there’s no faster path to this skill set than study abroad” (Goodman, 2009, p. 6).  However, do engineering majors who do study abroad feel they develop “the capacity to think and act on a global basis” as a result of their study abroad experience?  What outcomes do they self-report?  These and other questions were explored in this study. "

            "output": "The purpose of this study was to explore and analyze study abroad for engineering majors from both the students’ perspectives and academic advisors’ perspectives. Specifically, this study analyzed goals and motivations, facilitators and challenges, reflection, and outcomes of the study abroad experience.  Engineering students are under-represented in study abroad, yet the engineering profession is global and engineerswill need to adapt to the global workplace.  The current study used both Fishbien and Ajzen’s (1975) theory of reasoned action and Mezirow’s (1991) transformational learning theory as a guiding theoretical framework, andcombined Kasravi’s (2009) and Johnson’s (2016) models to form the conceptual framework.  To achieve the purpose of the study,fourresearch questionswere presented: 1.What are undergraduate engineering majors’ goals and motivations for studying abroad?2.What barriers and challenges do undergraduate engineering majors face in their attempts to study abroad?3.What outcomes do undergraduate engineering majors report as a result of studying abroad?4.What are academic advisors’ perspectives of undergraduate engineering majors’ goals and motivations for studying abroad, as well astheir perspectives ofbarriers and challenges that these students face? This chapter presents a summary and discussion of the major findings, as well as implications for theory and practice.General Outcomes This study also sought to explore and analyze the impact of study abroad for engineering majors.  Through both the survey and theindividual interviews, it is clear that studying abroad does have a strong impact.  On the survey, the two categories that were ranked closest to “strongly agree” were Impact on International/Intercultural Understanding and Competence and Impact on Personal Development.  Students strongly agreed that study abroad increased their insight and appreciation of other cultures.  Additionally, study abroad made them more self-reliant, independent, and increasedtheir self-confidence.  Bettez and Lineberry (2004) also found that students ranked personal outcomes over academic outcomes.  Engineering learning, in both the survey and the interview, was of secondary importance to students.  Other studies have also found that academic learning is secondary to the personal learning students experience while abroad (Bettez & Lineberry, 2004; Carlson et al., 1990; Chambers & Chambers, 2008).  One possible reason for this is that students in engineering majors, like students in other majors, go abroad for their own personal interest.  Perhaps they have a hierarchical view of American science education (Klahr & Ratti, 2000) so they would rather complete courses for their major at home.  In the current study, a few students did report that the education abroad was less rigorous than the education at home.  Some studies have measured engineering learning in engineering-specific study abroad programs (DiBiasio & Mello, 2004; Maldonado et al., 2014; Schubert & Jacobitz, 2013).  These studies tend to have more successful results in engineering learning, as they are focused on engineering.  The results from this study show that without purposeful planning in engineering, engineering learning is of secondary importance.  While many students appreciated the hands on nature of engineering learning while abroad, they did not find their technical skills to be much improved over courses taken at the home university.  Study abroad impacted students’ careers in three ways: by altering or confirming their career paths, by appealing to employers, and by interest in working internationally.  On the survey, students reported that they would feel comfortable working internationally and that study abroad was important to their professional development.  However in the interviews the outcomes were a little more nuanced.  While some students felt that study abroad made them a more attractive candidate to employers, others were unsure.  Additionally, three of 11students felt that after getting exposure to international living, they would not like to work internationally.  Outcomes by Program DurationMany studies have sought to measure outcomes based on program duration.  In this study, outcomes appeared to be nearly the same regardless of program duration.  The top two outcomes were the same: study abroad was important to students’ personal development and gave them increased insight into other cultures.  In a longitudinal study, Dwyer (2002) found that yearlongstudents were more likely to use a foreign language on a regular basis and were more likely to report that study abroad increased their self-confidence.  While these factors did not emerge as differences in this study, it is perhaps to soon to tell—in a retrospective study, these differences might emerge as more profound.  Ingraham and Peterson (2003) found differences in the impact of students’ career development as a result of studying abroad, indicating that the longer students went abroad, the more impactful the experience was for career development.  At this point, career development did not emerge as a significant difference in this study.Outcomes by GenderIn general, most outcomes did not vary significantly by gender.  This finding counters other studies (Vande Berg et al., 2009) which did find significant differences between males and females.  Unlike in other studies, for the few findings that did show significant differences, males actually reported stronger impacts than females.  In this study, males were more likely to report an increase in second-language competency than females.  In the Georgetown Consortium study (Vande Berg et al., 2009), females made significantly greater progress in foreign language acquisition than males.  While the results of this study were based on self-reports and not on a foreign language exam, it is promising to see that males did report an increase in second-language competency.  It is possible that the males in this study were highly motivated to learn a foreign language.  Indeed, both Jeffrey and Jim purposefully chose programs where the language of instruction was not English. Additionally in the Georgetown Consortium study, females made statistically significant gains in intercultural learning, while males did not.  In the currentstudy, males were more likely to have increased contact with international students on campus than females.  These findings seem to indicate that when males are highly motivated to study abroad and increase their intercultural competency and understanding, they do so at rates equal to, or higher than,females.  ReflectionInterview participants described reflecting in two ways: alone and with others.  Some students reflected in multiple ways, but in general reflection did not emerge as important for students to help them process what they learned abroad.  Some students found it either challenging or not important to reflect while abroad.While students in this study found it difficult to dedicate time to reflection, they are not unusual.  Many studies have found that often students will not reflect on their experiences without reflection timeincorporated into the education abroad curriculum.  In order for more transformational learningto occur, several studies show the importance of guided reflection (Paige & Goode, 2009; Root & Ngampornchai, 2012;Vande Berg et al., 2009; Wessels et al., 2011).  Students are less likely to reflect if they are not guided throughout their program.  If reflection truly is a key component to perspective change, then adding required guided reflection throughout programsis critical.  Additionally, students need to be guided on how to reflect.  Root and Ngampornchai (2012) suggest counseling students on the importance of reflection in pre-departure programs.  Implications of the Findings for Global EngineersOne of the purposes of this study was to determine if study abroad is an effective way to develop “global engineers.”The literature has reportedthat engineers need to become global engineers in order to be successful in their careers.In this study, the term global engineerwas explored through the development of global competency (Parkinson, 2009) and professional, or soft,skills (ABET Criterion 3 guidelines; Shuman et al., 2005).  Global CompetencyGlobal engineers must be globally competent.  This study utilized the conceptualization of global competencyfromParkinson (2009). Globally competent engineers possess the following characteristics: 1.can appreciate other cultures.2.are proficient working in or directing a team of ethnic and cultural diversity. 3.are able to communicate across cultures.4.have had a chance to practice engineering in a global context, whether through an international internship, a service-learning opportunity, a virtual global engineering project or some other form of experience.5.caneffectively deal with ethical issues arising from cultural or national differences. (p. 12-13) The students in this study reported outcomes similar to the attributes of global competency.  Because of studying abroad, they developed a strong appreciationfor other cultures and a new perspective of the world(attribute #1).  Many students had the opportunitiesto work in multi-ethnic teams, and all students learned the difficulties of communicating across cultures, especially when the dominant language is not Englishfor everyone involved(attributes #2 and #3).  While most students did take courses in engineering, not all students had the opportunity to practice hands-on engineering projects(attribute #4).  These skills would be better measured inengineering-specificlearning programs.  And while it is too soon to learn if students can effectively deal with cultural and national differences in their careers(attribute #5), the experiences of studying abroad did provide a strong foundation for enhanced global-mindedness.  Soft SkillsIt has been speculated that many of the soft skills recognized by the ABET Criterion 3 guidelines can be improved through study abroad.  Attempting to measure the growth of each of the soft skills was outside the scope of this study, but the findings did point to development offour skills: the ability to function on multidisciplinary teams;the ability to communicate effectively;the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context;andknowledge of contemporary issues.The students in this study reported that study abroad improved their ability to work as team members, particularly with students from other cultures.  Peter led a team ofother engineers in creating a Formula One racing car.  In this team, he had to navigate working with students from other cultures.  Michael explained that he was reluctant to work with a group of local Singapore students because he was unsure of their capabilitiesin computer science, but after working with them felt that they were just as competent, if not moreso, aspeers at his home university.  Additionally, it was apparent that they did come away from their experience with a broadened understanding of engineering. Students found “there’s more than one way to solve a problem.”  By taking courses abroad, they understood the engineering issues that people in other countries face.  Many students also described abilities to compare political and social issues with those of the United States.  Simply living abroad for a semester or more gave them the ability to identify important issues in their host countries.  Implications of the Findings for TheoryTheory of Reasoned ActionFishbien and Ajzen’s (1975) theory of reasoned action helps explain a person’s intent to perform a behavior; in this context, that behavior was the decision to study abroad.  The theory posits that two factors directly relate to a person’s intent to perform a behavior: his or her attitude toward the behavior and the subjective norm regarding the behavior.  The subjective norm consists of other peoples’ beliefs about performing the behavior, which may influence a person’s motivation to perform that behavior.Kasravi (2009), building on the theory based on research from Booker (2001) and Peterson (2003), re-conceptualized the theory of reasoned action as personal and social factors that help explain why students may or may not participate in study abroad.  Based on findings, she added a third determinant: institutional factors, like program cost and availability of classes, that also influence intent to study abroad.  Interview participants in this study confirmed that personal, social, and institutional factors facilitated or challenged study abroad participation.  Importantly, interview participants explained the challenges of using courses takenabroad to satisfymajor requirements.  These institutional challenges could only be overcome through their strong internal drive to study abroad, which for some students meant extending their time to degree.  Considering that students’ strong desires to study abroad helped them to overcome these challenges recognizes that both personal and institutional factors can facilitate study abroad. Transformational Learning Theory The experiences abroad, which encompasses interacting with individuals from other cultures, becomes a catalyst for deep change. Transformational learning theory(Mezirow, 1991) is a theoretical description of the steps that learners go through to change their worldviews (Brock, 2009).  As Brock explains, “transformative learning is when a learner is struck by a new concept or way of thinking and then follows through to make a life change” (p. 2). Transformational learning theory provides a theoretical underpinning forthe possibilityof becominga global engineer and transforming in other ways as a result ofstudy abroad.  A disorienting dilemma serves as a catalyst for transformation.  In this study, as in other studies focusing on study abroad, the study abroad experience served as the disorienting dilemma.Much research indicates the importance of reflection in leading to perspective change.  In this study, reflection was not of central importance to interview participants.  However, one student, Peter, indicated a type of reflection that is less common in the literature: taking pictures and reviewing what he saw at the end of the day.  Due to the prevalence of cameras, students can easily take pictures of what they saw or thought of.  This type of reflection not only engages students who might consider journal writing not useful, it also helps students process their experiences in a new way.  Additionally, reflection after the experience abroad is necessary as well.  It may be that the experience is too chaotic or fast-paced to stop and think about what they are learning.  But when students return home andcontinue to reflect, that is when the transformative learning actually occurs.  Measuring transformation may also not be possible in a short timeframe.  Some research does question whether transformation is “cataclysmic” or “gradual” (Brock, 2009).  In this study it appearsthat the process of transformation extends beyond students’ return home, perhaps even several months or years after their experience.  Measuring transformative learning too soon may cause students to feel they were not actually “transformed.”Integrated Conceptual Model In light of the findings from this study, the integrated conceptual model used for this study needs to be revised(see Figure 6.1).  Kasravi’s (2009) conceptual model (Figure 1.1) displays factors that positively influence study abroad.  Her findings revealed that personal factors weighed more heavily in decision-making than the social and institutional factors.While personal factors certainly outweighed others in terms of positively influencing study abroad, themodel must also incorporate barriers to studying abroad as well.  Institutional barriers (such as academics) weighed more heavily than personal and social barriers.  For that reason,the model in this study is revised to express the importance of both institutional factors and personal factors in engineering students’ decision-making regarding study abroad.Regarding transformational learning, Johnson's (2016) model (Figure 1.3) indicated that transformation ends before students return home.  However, this study concluded that transformation appears to continue when students return home, as they are making sense of their experience and understanding how their new perspectives will impact their daily lives.  For some students, this newfound perspective willcontinue as meaning schemes, whereas for others the newfound perspective will change their meaning perspective and become transformational learning.  Additionally, reflection appears to either start while students are abroad or once they return home.  Forthat reason, reflection was also added to the model to indicate that reflection is ongoing. Implications of the Findings for PracticeOne of the purposes of this study was to increase study abroad participation for engineering majors.  The findings of this study are valuable to both personnel in the college Home Background and Institution ContextDecision-Making Regarding Study Abroad Host Institution ContextWhile AbroadHome Institution Context and BeyondUpon ReturnOutcomes Personal  Factors Social  Factors Institutional Factors Attitude Toward Study Abroad  Decision to Study Abroad  Disorienting Dilemma Process of Transformation Return Home of engineering (faculty, administrators, and advisors) as well as study abroad offices.  These implications and recommendations come not only from the findings of this study but also from suggestions by students and advisors themselves.  Pre-Departure PhaseRecruiting engineering majors.In this study, few participants reported making the decision to study abroad because of the opportunity to develop as engineers.  However, the “soft skills”students developed abroad may be just as important as any technical skills that can be offered.  Particularlyin programs that are not geared toward engineering majors, the learning of soft skillscan be emphasized.  Recruitment material may need toinclude how study abroad helpsstudents develop valuable career-related skills, in addition to technical skills.  Academic advisors play an important role in promoting study abroad.  They encourage study abroad in the following ways: by speaking positively about the study abroad experience in general, by showing students how it is possible to fit study abroad into their 4-year plan, and by connecting prospective students with returned engineering students.  Advisors must also have accurate, updated information for students.  Misinformation can inhibit participation.  Advisors are particularly effective when they are familiar with program options that help students make progress toward their degrees.  Peer advisors can be just as effective if they are well-informed. Goldstein and Kim (2006) suggested encouraging participation by moving beyond academic integrationand careerdevelopment.  Instead, institutions are encouraged to develop programs on campus that give students accurate expectations regarding study abroad, increase their intercultural understanding and competence, and facilitate language learning.  With these objectives in mind, engineering students in particular may be more likely to want to studyabroad.  Faculty support, through both encouraging study abroad in their classrooms and by approving coursework taken abroad,is particularly crucial during this stage.  Research has shown that students are more likely to go abroad with strong support from faculty (Klahr &Ratti, 2000; Grandin & Hirleman, 2009; O’Hara, 2009; Paus & Robinson, 2008; Relyea et al., 2008; Spiering & Erickson, 2006).  Educating faculty on the importance of studying abroad for both academics and the development of important intercultural skills is key.  Any mechanisms or initiatives to encourage faculty to expedite decisions on course transferabilitywould enhance student participation.  Oftentimes students were deterred from studying abroad because faculty could not determine pre-departureif courses would meet major requirements.   Incorporating study abroad into engineering curriculum.One major barrier to engineering majors studying abroad is the rigidity of the engineering curriculum.  The strict guidelines set by ABET have been blamed for reducing the flexibility of the curriculum (Klahr & Ratti, 2000).  Even if curriculum requirements cannot change, it is possible to integrate study abroad into the curriculum.  For example, allow students one specific quarter they can study abroad. In this study, amajor challenge for students was finding courses that would satisfydegree requirements.  Colleges of engineering and the SAPO must work together so that students can easily find courses to take abroad. Colleges can facilitate study abroad by not only pre-approving coursesfor credit (as many study abroad programs already do) but also approving these courses to fulfill general education and major requirements(which is far less common).  Study abroad offices can facilitate access by giving students an easy way to find classes that are appropriate to take abroad, particularly courses that are appropriate forengineering majors.  Theseoffices are encouraged to maintain a database of courses that have been approved for major or general education credit and make them easy to find.  For universities with multi-campus systems, courses that have been approved at one campus as a course equivalent should also be approved at other campuses.  For example, if a course on “Dynamics” taken at a university abroad was approved by one campus in the system, it should be acceptable at all campuses in the system.    Program Phase One of the goals of study abroad programming for engineering majors is to encourage the development of engineers who are prepared to work globally and interact successfully with people from diverse cultures. To encourage this type of transformational learning, guided reflection is necessary to help students understand what they are learning and how these new experiences and skills can help them in the future.  Guided reflection should be incorporated into the curriculum.  As Taylor (2008) explains, educators must “take time to know students as individuals, recognizing their preferences, and engaging a variety of approaches in fostering transformative learning (p. 12).   This means that students should not be limited to reflecting through journals.  Some students may prefer talking with others or even taking pictures or drawing as a means of reflection. Returnee PhaseResults from this study suggest that students are unclear how employers may value their study abroad experience.  Additionally, while students gained many career-related skills by studying abroad, they were not always able to see the connections to their future careers. Career counselors could help students transfer the attitudes, skills, and abilities they learned from studying abroad ontotheir resumes.   Peer role models have been found to be important influences of study abroad, both in this study and in the literature reviewed.  Advisors should ask study abroad returnees to give testimonials of their experience.  Students who have successfully studied abroad for an academic year should be particularly encouraged to report on their experiences in order to show students that yearlong programs are possible.  Limitations and Recommendations for Future ResearchWhile this study contributes to the limited research in study abroad programming for engineering majors, there are a few limitations that must be mentioned. First, this study focused on one university system.  Future studies may wish to broaden the sampleto different university types or different locations throughout the United States.  Second, acommon limitation with study abroad research is self-selection bias, where students who choose to participate in the study are more inclined to describe favorable experiences and outcomes.  However, including varying program durations (like summer, semester, and yearlong) allowed for more variation in the outcomes. While both males and females were asked to participate in interviews, there was a gender imbalanceinthe interviews.  All academic advisors were female, and all students were male.While this does limit the generalizability of the findings,it was also important to hear the male voice, as male participation in study abroad is generally much lower than that for females (IIE, 2015c).  Future studies may wish to expand the definition of a “global engineer” and explore the development of global engineers during university study.  Researchers might ask experts in the field to define a global engineer.  Anadditional study could also look at what it means to be a global engineer in a different context, such as in a work setting.  Outside of the limitations, there are also several additional areas that are important to continue with future research.  Researchers might use the same survey or interview protocols with students from other majors.  Additionally, because longitudinal studies are lacking in the study abroad literature, it would be useful to follow up with students in 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years. It would be useful to compare engineers who had an international experience while in collegewith thosewho did notto measure global competency and the development of soft skills.Further, this study examined academic advisors’ perspectives on study abroad; faculty could comprise another study focus.  Engineering faculty have notably been less likely to encourage students to participate in international experiences (Grandin & Hirleman, 2009; O’Hara, 2009).  Future research could interview engineering faculty members to explore what is restricting them from encouraging study abroad."

            "tl;dr": "",         
            "abstract": "Extensive literature on study abroad outcomes documents the benefits of study abroad for all undergraduate students, regardless of academic major.  However, engineering majors, at 5% of all undergraduate students nationally who study abroad, are substantially less likely to study abroad than their social science peers, at 17.3% participation (IIE, 2016).  Yet engineering majors have much to gain from international experiences: engineering is a global profession, and these future engineers will be expected not only to work in diverse teams but also travel and work abroad.  The purpose of this study is: (a)to explore the goals, motivations and challenges or barriers that undergraduate engineering majors face in their decision-making regarding study abroad, particularly in comparison to those motivations and barriers identified in the literature;(b) to identify outcomes of study abroad for this group of students and how they believe study abroad might impact their future; and (c) to explore students’ decision-making regardingengineering study abroad from academic advisors’ perspectives.These advisors not only support undergraduates’ academic needs on campus but also help them plan for study abroad. The theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Azjen, 1975) andtransformational learning theory (Mezirow, 1991) formed the theoretical framework for this study.  Combined, these theories form the basis of a conceptual model to explain the decision-making process of studying abroad and how study abroad can be a transformative learning experience for study abroad participants.This study employed a mixed methods methodology (Creswell, 2014) to address the research questions.  First, a survey was sent to engineering undergraduates who had participated in study abroad at 8 different undergraduate institutionswithin a university system.  Then, based on survey responses, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 of the survey participants.  Concurrently, 7 academic advisors were interviewed in order to shed light on the advising process for engineering majors to study abroad.   Personal and institutional factors were found to be the primary considerations in deciding whether to study abroad.Personal factors included students’ desires forcultural experiences and their internal driveto overcome any obstacles they faced.  Institutionally, curriculum restrictions for engineering majors and student fearsabout delay in graduationchallenged study abroad participation.  Outcomes included students’ alteration of career plans, increasing their insight into other cultures, and increasing their comfort with working abroad.",

            "output": "Globalization requires that engineering graduates become global engineers.  Global engineers are expected to embody the tenets of global competency and utilize the so-called soft skills in order to be successful in their careers.  This study attempted to determine if study abroad could develop global engineers.  While the definition of global engineering was limited, the students in this study showed promising characteristics consistent with global engineering.  Study abroad has proved to be an effective way at developing these important traits and skills. While the benefits of studying abroad for engineering majors are quite clear, the road to participation is difficult.  Both academic advisors and the students themselves identified barriers to participation, such as stringent academic requirements and the need for experiences like research and internships that employers seemingly value more.  Participation in study abroad is more likely when students themselves have an internal drive that motivates them to study abroad in spite of the barriers, and when academic advisors have carefully planned studying abroad into students’ degree plans.  In order for study abroad to be a truly beneficial international experience, students need support while abroadthat encourages them to become global engineers.  Particularly, guided reflection is an important way to help students make meaning of their experience.  With the support of a cultural mentoras emphasized in other literature (Anderson et al., 2006; Paige & Goode, 2009; Root & Ngampornchai, 2012; Vande Berg et al., 2009), students are likely to make connections between their experience abroad and the experiences employers are looking for.  Vande Berg and colleagues found that when students met with a cultural mentor “very often,” their intercultural learning scores dramatically increased.  Their time abroad serves more than just as a vacation or as a semester away; instead, it becomes a meaningful experience that helps them not only in their future careers but also in their personal lives."
