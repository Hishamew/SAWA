            "output": "The study of uranium heteroatom multiple bonds in recent years has yielded a wealth of information in how f-orbitals interact in bonding different atoms.1-6In addition, the study of uranyl and uranylanalogues has led to more information on the covalency of f-orbitals in the actinides. 1,7-11These studies have shown that f-orbitals in actinides do participate in the π-bonding in the metal ligandmultiple bonds.12Because of this information there has been a desire to synthesize new complexes containing new actinide ligand multiple bonds to study how the f-orbitals interact in bonds. Because the studyofuranyl has yielded a wealth of knowledge regarding the f-orbitals it has been proposed that studying systems that contain more than two uranium heteroatom multiple bonds would be fruitful as well. Recent work has succeeded in synthesizing complexes that contain three multiple bonds to heteroatoms.13The Bart group in collaboration with the Schelter group synthesized a uranium tris(imido complex). Upon reactinguranium tris-iodide with diisopropylphenyl (DIPP) azide in thepresence ofKC8,they synthesized the uranium tris(imido) complex(eq 2.1).14In this complex the imido ligands are coordinated in a facial orientation and not a uranyl like structure as would be desired. To remedy this a pyridine(diimine) (PDI) ligand was used to create a uranyl like environment about the uranium center.Having observed the synthesis of these complexes, we endeavored to synthesize new uranium complexes containing more than two multiple bonds. The target complex that was selected was the complex known as “reverse uranyl” that has only been observed in the solid state. 16Reverse uranyl describes a complex that contains four short multiple bonds in an equatorial plane and two long single bonds in an axial position. This would be the direct opposite of uranyl, which contains two short multiple bonds in the axial position and four long single bonds in the equatorial plane.17,18Reverse uranyl would be a dianionic compound which was previously thought to be too unstable,but calculationshave shown this to be a feasible, somewhat stable product.19This complex has been studied theoretically;it has been observed in the solid state however,a discrete independent molecule has not yet been synthesizedto confirm the theoretical structure. It has been recently hypothesized that the reverse uranyl may in fact distort into a tetrahedral environment instead of the previously hypothesized square planar geometry.20To explore the electronic structure and compare it to the proposed configuration we endeavored to synthesize this reverse uranyl.To synthesize reverse uranyl, we chose to utilize the method of reductive deprotection that has been used previously to synthesize several complexes containing metal heteroatom multiple bonds.21This method utilized the reductive bond cleavage of a bond between a protecting group and a heteroatom to form a metal heteroatom multiple bond. In the previous work by the Hayton group, the protecting group that was utilized was the triphenylmethyl group(eq 2.2.). Our objective is to first synthesize the uranyl alkoxide complex then reduce the complex and form reverse uranyl. Uranium alkoxide complexes have been studied for several decades and Gillman and coworkers first reported the preparation of uranium alkoxides and later Bradley and coworkers reported more uranium alkoxide complexes.16,22-27Uranyl alkoxide complexes can be made through either a salt metathesis or a ligand metathesis. The salt metathesis method utilizes a halide complex of uranyl and an alkali metal complex of the alkoxide ligand.28This method produces the corresponding salt and the desired alkoxide. However there is often the formation of a uranyl tris(alkoxide) ate complex. The second method utilizes a ligand metathesis. This method utilizes a metathesis with a uranyl amide complex and the desired alcohol. This reaction forms the desired alkoxide complex and an amine as the byproduct(eq 2.3).29This method is preferred due to the lack of possible byproducts from the reaction mixture.In this chapter the synthesis of the uranyl alkoxide, UO2(OCPh3)2THF2is discussed as well as the synthesis of the uranyl thiolate complex UO2(SCPh3)2THF2. The reactivity of these complexes toward several reducing agents is explored. The behavior of these complexes toward reducing agents is probed and the deviation from the expected reactivity is discussed."

Upon decanting the supernatant, the yellow solid UO2(OCPh3)2(THF)2(2.1) can be isolated in 81% yield (eq 2.4). Re-dissolution of the yellow solid in THF and diffusion of hexanes at -25°C affordssingle crystals of 2.1as yellow plates.Complex 2.1crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n, and its solid state structure is shown in Figure 2.1. In the solid state, complex 2.1 displays anoctahedral environment about the uranium center (O1-U1-O1 = 180.0°). The alkoxide ligands are in the trans configuration as opposed to a cis conformation. Both THF molecules are coordinatedtothe metal center.

The uranyl bond distances are both 1.791(5) Å, which is typical for uranyl bond distances.30,31The uranium alkoxide bond distances are 2.137(6) Å, which is very similar to the uranyl bis(triphenylphosphine oxide) (TPPO) bis t-butyl alkoxide synthesized by Burns and co-workers, which has an U-OAlkoxidebond distance of 2.143(6)Å.28The coordination environment of the alkoxide and coordinating solvent around the uranyl is typical of UO2R12R22complexes with monodentate ligands.The 1H NMRspectrumof complex 2.1in THF-d8exhibitstworesonances in the phenyl region at 7.14 ppm and 7.70ppm,corresponding to the phenyl protons of the alkoxide ligand. In the NMR spectrum there is also residual Et2O from the reaction. The complex is not completely soluble in THF and will begin to precipitate outof solution after approximately 15 minutes. The slow diffusion of a diethyl-ether solution of 2 equiv of Ph3COH into a diethyl ether/hexanes solution of UO2[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2at -25°C results in the deposition of orange plate like crystals(eq 2.5). X-ray diffraction reveals the structure to be UO2(OCPh3)2(THF)(Et2O)(2.2). Complex 2.2crystalizes in the triclinic space group P-1 and itssolid statestructure is shown in Figure 2.2. In the solid state, complex 2.2exhibits a pseudo-octahedral environment around the uranium center (O5-U1-O6 = 167.9(1)°).  The alkoxide ligands are in a cis configuration as opposed to the trans configuration in complex 2.1. The distortion from an octahedral environment is most likely due to the bulky triphenylmethyl alkoxide ligands being in the cis arrangement. The large steric profile of the triphenylmethyl alkoxide ligands cause a distortion from an octahedral coordination environment and the Et2O and THF areforced closer to each other to reduce the steric pressure around the alkoxides. This configuration is most likely the less favorable of the two, as evidenced by the reconfiguration to the trans configuration upon being dissolved and recrystallized from THF."

            "output": "The isolation of UO2(OCPh3)2THF2(2.1), UO2(OCPh3)2(THF)(Et2O)(2.2), and  UO2(SCPh3)2(THF)2(2.3), show that the methodology of utilizing ligand metathesis is a excellent method of synthesizing unsupported alkoxide and thiolate complexes. Uranyl thiolate complexes are extremely rare, and complex 2.3is only the second unsupported unidentate uranyl thiolate synthesized. Unfortunately, through reactivity studies of these complexes it was found that the reductionof complexes 2.1, 2.2and 2.3does not form the desired reverse uranyl or the sulfur substituted reverse uranyl. The reduction of these complexes reduces the uranium center to uranium(IV), while the ligand is removed from the metal and the free alkoxide or thiolate is formed. The use of potassium graphite resulted in the formation of KOCPh3, KSCPH3and the utilization of decamethylcobaltacene resulted in the formation of [CoCp*2][SCPh3](2.4) while decamethylcobaltacene showed no reactivity with complexes 2.1and 2.2. While these complexes did not show the desired reactivity we were able to show that it is easier to reduce offthe alkoxide or thiolate ligands and reduce the metal center than to break the oxygen-carbon or sulfur-carbon bonds.
