The roles of CAPAD parameters on the resulting  microstructure  are  presented.  Specifically,  experiments  have  been  conducted  to find the appropriate parameters to produce samples containing the necessary densities and microstructure. The majority of the experiments showthe effectsof processing temperature and  hold  time  on  the  final  density  of  the  Mg2Si  samples.Finally,  three final bulk  samples were chosen for property measurement."

            "output": "3.2.1Powder ProcessingPlanetary  ball  milling  is  a  common  technique  to  break  down  powder  particulates and reducethe grain size. With this technique, jars and balls made of various hard materials such  as  stainless  steel,  agate,  tungsten  carbide,  silicon  nitride,  etc,  are  spun  around  in  a planetary  gear  fashion.  The  jars  are  located  at  the  planetary  gear  positions  where  the rotation  from  the  sun  wheel  combined  with  the  jars  produce  greater  acceleration  than  the individual  gear  positions.  The  repeated  shear  and  impact  forces  between  the  balls  and  jar walls  break  down  the  particulates [29].  Main  parameters  include  the  RPM  of  the  jars, duration,  ball  size,  number  of  balls,  and  ball  to  powder  ratio.  A  Frisch  Premium  Line Pulverisette  7  planetary  ball  mill  with  stainless  steel  balls  and jars  was  used  for  the  work presented in this thesis.The  Mg2Si  starting  powder  was  purchased  from  Alfa  Aesar  with  20  mesh  size  and 99.9%  metals  basis  purity.  The  powder  to  ball  weight  ratio  used  was  1:20  and  4.7  mm diameter  steel  balls  were  used.  The  ballmilling  parameters  used  were  300  RPM  for  6  and 12 hours and 600 RPM for 48 hours. The speed of 600 RPM for 48hours was chosenas an extreme case to check if further powder refinement could be achieved.3.2.2CAPADThe  powder  was  consolidated  inside  graphite  plungers  and  dies. Traditionally,  the CAPAD  uses  a  single  die  setup  for  producing  samples  with  a  diameter  of  19mm.  In  this work, aspecially designed mini system consisting of a small die within a larger die was used to  produce  samples  of  9.5mm  in  diameter.  The  smaller  sized  samples  were  achieved  by fabricating  a  smaller  die  and  plunger  set  that  rests  inside  the  regular  system  as  illustrated by Figure 3.1.  This  allows  for  less  powder  to  be  expended  per  sample.  It  is  particularly useful for determining densification parameters for powders of limited supply where many experiments need to be done.A    typical    CAPAD    experiment    requires    the    application    of    pressure    while simultaneously heating the sample. During the pressure ramp portion, very little current is supplied  to  the  sample  and  dies  so  as  to  not  cause  excessive  stress  from  the  loading  and thermal expansion. Once the desired pressure is reached, the true temperature ramp is put into  effect  as illustrated  by Figure 3.2.  The  particularsetup  uses  an  Instron  model  5584 testing machine. The Instron machine provides precise control over compressive forces and extension. This allows for real time densification monitoring.The starting  powders  were  loaded  into  the  dies  and  first  compacted  at  112 MPa at room temperature for one minute. These green compacts were then processed at 112 MPa of  pressure  with  a  load  rate  of  37.3  MPa/min. The  temperature  ramp  during  this  pressure ramp  was  held  at  a  rate  of  100 °C/min.  Once  the  pressure  stabilized  at  112  MPa, the temperature  ramp  was  increased  to  200 °C/min  until  reaching  the  desired  processing temperature.Two separate hold times were used, 1 and 5 minutes. These hold times began once the sample reached their processing temperatures.Densities were measured using the Archimedes  method  in  ethanol  due  to  the  samples  reactivity  with  water.  The  Archimedes method  relies  on  the  difference  in  object  weight  due  to  the  buoyancy  force  acting  on  a submerged object in a fluid with known properties to calculate density of the object.3.2.3Microstructure AnalysisAnalysis of the powder was aided through the use of a Bruker D8 Advance for x-ray diffraction (XRD) and a Philips FEG XL30 scanning electron microscope (SEM). XRD analysis provided  information  about  both  composition  and  microstructure.  Using  the  Scherrer equation, crystallite size can be estimated from the XRD peak patterns [30]:3.1where χis the mean crystallite size, Kis the shape factor, λis the x-ray wavelength, Bis the full width half maximum (FWHM), and θis the Bragg angle. The  Bragg  angle  at  which  the  peaks occur  can  also  reveal  information  about  the crystal  structure.  If  the  peak  shifts  are  attributed  towards  a  change  in  crystallographic lattice parameters, then the amount of change is calculable using Bragg’s law:3.2where nis an integer of a given order, λis the wavelength of the x-ray, θis the incident angle, and dis the plane spacing. Since Mg2Si crystallizes in a cubic structure, the relationship between plane spacing and lattice parameter takes the form of:3.3where h,k,lare the Miller indices and ais the lattice parameter [30].3.2.4PropertyMeasurementsElectrical  conductivity  of  the  samples  was  measured  using  the  home  built  current source  described  in  Chapter  2.  Samples  were  formed  into  bars  of  known  dimensions  and polished using  a  Buehler  EcoMet  3000  wheel  polisher  and  silicon  carbide  polishing  paper with a final polish of 1μm diamond solution. An alcohol base lubricant was used.Four wires were   then   attached   to   the   bars   to   perform   a   4   point   probe   electrical   resistivity measurement.Seebeck  coefficients  of  the  samples  were  measured  using  the  technique  described by   Tritt [18].   Samples  were   cut   into   bars   (The   bars  used   for   electrical   conductivity measurements  were  also  used  in  the  Seebeck  coefficient  measurements.)  with  a  heater attached to one end and  a heat sink on the other. A strain gauge was used as the heater to produce  joule  heating  while  an  aluminum  block  was  used  as  the  heat sink.Thermocouples and  voltage  leads  were  placed  at  both  ends  to  measure  the  temperature  and  voltage  drop across the sample.Thermal  conductivity  was  calculated  from  the  measured  density,  specific  heat capacity, and measured thermal diffusivity. A custom setup was used for the measurement of thermal diffusivity in accordance with parameters outlined in ASTM C714-85. An infrared laser  with  30W  of  effluence  was  used  to  heat  the  front  of  the  sample.  The  sample  was suspended  in air  by  attaching  a  thermocouple  to  the  backside.  Convection  losses  were minimized by keeping the sample in an enclosed area. The 3ω method was not used due to issues with the heater line micro-fabrication. Thermal conductivity is the summation of the phonon   contribution   and   electron   contribution   among   other   energy   carriers.   The relationship  between  electrical  conductivity  and  electron  thermal  conductivity  is  given  by the Wiedemann-Franz Law.3.4where κeis the electron contribution to thermal conductivity, σ is the electrical conductivity, L is the Lorentz number, and T is the temperature. The Lorentz number used in the calculation was 1.5 x10-8W/S K2for a non-degenerate semiconductor [32]."

            "abstract": "Thermoelectric  materials  are  unique  in  their  ability  to  directly  convert  thermal energy  into  electrical.  Various  applications  include:  energy  scavenging,  spot  cooling  and heating,  and  interstellar  power  generation. Current  research  is geared  towards  improving thermoelectricmaterials  for  greater  energy  conversion  efficiency.  Mg2Si has  beenagood candidate  for studydue  to  its  low  toxicity,  low  density,  and  availability  of  constituent elements.   Recent   efforts   to   improve   efficiency   of bulk thermoelectric   materials   have included,  but are not  limited  to, changing  the  electronic  band  structure  through  doping oraltering the microstructure. While the former has beenwellstudied and verified, the latter remains   relatively   untouched   experimentally.   There   is evidence   that   thermoelectric materials with low dimensionality show improvement in certain properties. Thin films andnanowires  areknown  to  have  lower  thermal  conductivities  than  their  bulk  counterparts. The goal of this work is to provide evidence of microstructural effects on the thermoelectric properties of bulk Mg2Si.The three relevant properties for thermoelectric materials are thermal conductivity, electrical  conductivity,  and  the  Seebeck  coefficient. Because  commercial measurement systems  are costly and  have  limited measurement  ranges  and  accuracies,  the  development of custom equipment is sometimes necessary.An electrical AC current source is developed and  used  to  measure  the  electrical  conductivity  and,through  the3ω method, thermal conductivity  of  bulk  samples.  The  measured  values  are  comparable,  with  a 3%  agreement,to a separate well-established system.Thebulksamples   are   consolidated   from   powder   using   the   Current   Activated Pressure  AssistedDensification  (CAPAD)  process.It is  knownthat  different  processing temperatures  alter  the amount  of  grain  growth  during  the  densification  process.  Samplesprocessed  at  highertemperaturesshow  increasing  thermal  and  electrical  conductivities while  the  Seebeck  coefficientdecreases.  These  trends  lead  to  a  maximum  figure  of  merit value with the sample processed at an intermediate temperature.",

            "output": "Samples   with   varying thermoelectric   propertieswere   successfully   synthesized. Planetary  ball  milling  reduced  the  grainsize  of  the  starting  powder.  Samples  processed  at lower  temperatures havea  reduction  in  both  electrical  and  thermal  conductivitieswhile increasing  the  Seebeck  coefficient. Currently  there  is  evidence  to  relate  the  thermoelectric properties  to  a  change  in  microstructure  as measuredfrom  XRD  analysis.  More  intensive investigation   into   the   microstructure   is   still   neededthrough   TEM   analysis,energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy."
