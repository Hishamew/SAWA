Catch up here: \nChapter 1: https://www.facebook.com/facebook/posts/pfbid02beo4ALzdVCd42BP5w945V8JEvSWLkLLzr95mp5SFu7svjV9WEx4WtWZCtesigJBxl\nChapter 2: https://www.facebook.com/facebook/posts/pfbid0frLMHWxDBhTkfezhKvzvS9xE8tFESBeKSKEuNyXXvj6ZVKgFZmWCK7rYP13eBCyhl\nWe last left our bookworms as their battle for a rare fantasy book broke out into a full dance battle. Alex busted out his tango talents while Jamie fought back with some disco dancing. The dance battle for the book ends in a clumsy spectacle. As the two dance through the bookstore, Alex’s makeshift cloak gets caught on a chair, making him topple over and drag Jamie with him. The two tumble into a display of books, making a gigantic mess. The annoyed bookstore owner comes over. Apologetically, the two help tidy things up and come to the conclusion that sharing the rare book over some coffee might be the better (and less chaotic) solution.\nThough this playful first date definitely put a spell over them, we know their story is just beginning… 📚 🕺✨💃 💘"
