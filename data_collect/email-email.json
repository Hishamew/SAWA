He was first trained for two years in Beijing Normal University and assigned to work as a high school teacher. His desire, however, was to instruct English in a university. Then he entered the Beijing Institute of Education to study English for another two years . His academic record was exceptionally good, especially in American literature course.\n﻿\nNow, He has graduated from the institute and hopes to study further abroad, which will benefit his future employment prospect and may help fulfil his desire.\n﻿\nI should appreciate it very much if you would consider him.\n﻿\nYours sincerely,\nLi Ming</content>"

I have a happy holiday just like you do. This holiday, I visited to Guangzhou with my parents. Guangzhou, also known as the Flower City, there are many flowers along the both sides of streets. It’s very beautiful. Besides, the environment is clean and the climate is comfortable. There are many skyscrapers in Guangzhou, especially in the downtown. We visited to many tourist attractions. They are all worth visiting. I hope you can visit there personally one day. You must like it.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nSincerely yours,\nAlva</content>"
