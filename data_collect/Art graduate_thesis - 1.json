            "output": "The turn of the twentieth century brought about a renewed interest in human prehistory. Throughout the nineteenth century, major archaeological discoveries were uncovered; among the most well-known discoveries are the investigations of Monte Albán in southern Mexico from 1859 onward, the numerous cave paintings and rock art found in Europe and Central America, and the first hominid fossils found in 1891. Great minds like Charles Darwin spurred the conversation forward by claiming, among other arguments, that humankind originated in Africa; the fact that the first hominid was found in Asia sparked a debate against Darwin’s claim. On top of these discoveries was the continuing fascination for previous cultures, like that of ancient Egyptian and ancient Greco-Roman peoples. Consequently, the formation of human history became a widely discussed topic for scholars and the educated public in the mid to late nineteenth century. And though this interest diminished following the outbreak of two great wars, it was rekindled again with the discovery of the cave art in the famous Lascaux Cave in France in 1940, as well as other caves in the Dordogne department of southwestern France. We continue to uncover new discoveries today, shattering older perceptions of the prehistoric timeline and shifting our previous knowledge of the time before written history. Though many of the more well-known caves are now closed in an effort to preserve the art, the less popular caves are still open to the general public. Because of the mystery surrounding it, prehistoric art remains a popular subject of debate between theorists, historians, scientists, and philosophers alike. Among those who visit the caves are also artists. As art and artifacts were uncovered in caves across Western Europe, the disciplines of art history and archaeology were connected more than they ever had been. Archaeologists used art historical terms to define the prehistoric art they found, and art historians acknowledged prehistoric art as the beginning of art history. But despite this acknowledgment, art historians neglected to change the overall story of art history in regard to its beginnings. However, this has not stopped people from connecting prehistoric art with modern motifs in art. Pablo Picasso, for example, claimed to have never drawn inspiration from prehistoric art, yet people still draw connections between his “primitive” style and the prehistoric depictions of animals and humans on cave walls. These ideas have melded into popular culture; even if a person has not visited one of the many caves with evidence of prehistoric humans across the globe, they will no doubt be familiar with the caveman concept from cartoons like The Flintstones, comic strips like “B.C.” (Figure 1), or even alien conspiracy theories (like the “ancient astronauts” hypothesis). Although there is no documented correlation between Picasso’s work and prehistoric art, other Western Modern artists did acknowledge their direct inspiration from cave art. When she entered one of the many prehistoric caves in the southwest of France in 1983, Elaine de Kooning found an unexpected theme for her next series, which she named Cave Walls. Through analyzing the direct connection between Elaine de Kooning’s Cave Walls series and the prehistoric art found in Europe, I intend to argue for the significant effect that prehistoric art had on several Western Modern artists in the latter half of the twentieth century. Culling from examples in Contemporary Art, I will explain that this interest in prehistoric art does not reveal itself in a singular artist but within entire communities of artists. With this in mind, I will lay out evidence of how prehistoric art has become regarded as an afterthought in the larger field of art history, and I intend to demonstrate that prehistoric art is not an afterthought but a continuous, collective memory in the minds of today’s society, shaping the way we view the world."

            "output": " Though Elaine de Kooning, Pierre Soulages, and various digital and street artists focus on cave paintings found in western Europe, there are other Modern and Contemporary artists who draw inspiration from different prehistoric cultures. Chinese artist Han Meilin has had his reinterpretations of Chinese rock art exhibited in the Yinchuan World Rock Art Museum. American artist and rock art researcher Elanie Moore finds inspiration in rock art from Mexico and practices prehistoric artistic techniques in her paintings. The fascination with prehistoric art stretches beyond the popular images from Lascaux and Altamira. Prehistoric art is quickly becoming a global phenomenon, spurring artists to take inspiration from their ancestors and reimagine the modern world. And perhaps this is only a passing fashion. Perhaps this fascination ends sooner rather than later. That does not make this prehistoric renaissance any less valid for both the artists and the study of art history. The Fauvist movement, for example, was a short-lived period of art (approximately from 1904 to 1910) that was practiced by a small group of Western artists, and yet it holds an important place in art history textbooks as an extension of Impressionism and a precursor to Expressionism. The Cubist movement only lasted for about seven years, and yet students are taught that without Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, movements such as Futurism, Dada, and De Stijl might have never developed. Art history students are consistently taught the importance of connections between cultures, histories, and movements. We are taught that without the ingenuity of the past, we would not have the development of the future. Because of this neo-prehistoric art movement that we find ourselves within, now is the ideal time to revolutionize the way we learn about art history. It is time to rewrite the textbooks to emphasize the art historical and cultural relevance of prehistoric art in a modern and contemporary art context. As de Kooning impresses upon in her first encounters with prehistoric art, the concepts of past and present become null. Time ceases to exist. Yet within art historical studies, the notions of “before common era” and “common era” encourage separation between past and present, and it subsequently establishes a disconnect. But how can we call ourselves true art historians if we only consider certain parts of art history when analyzing present trends in art? The fundamental definition of the study of history is that it is an investigative discipline that seeks to understand events of the past and analyze the causes and effects of these past events. As of today, the discipline of art history widely neglects the effects of prehistoric artistic behaviors. Maybe this is because the circumstances of prehistoric art are speculative – everything is based in theory, everything is up for personal interpretation. But isn’t that what art history is all about?"
