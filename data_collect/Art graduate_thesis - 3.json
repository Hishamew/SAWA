            "input": "",         
            "output": "In an essay for Artforum’s fiftieth anniversary issue in 2012, scholar Claire Bishop posits: “Whatever happened to digital art?”1Despite the backlash that Bishop received after her essay was published, this leadingquestion and its ensuingcontroversy are very much present in the world of contemporary art, which has institutions and galleries dedicated to only it and its postmodernity (or lack thereof). However, I do not feel that something has happened to digital art, but rather, digital art has been oft-separated from the rest of the so-called fine arts. Shortly after her initial question, Bishop wonders why digital works have not thoroughly “[filtered] affect through the digital,” and with this remark, I firmly believe digital works, or artworks built with the technological, fully utilize affect with the apparatus and especially so in the institutional space.The most pertinentpart of Bishop’s argument isthe prescribed backlash inits aftermath. Curator Lauren Cornell co-penned a response to the essay with Brian Droitcour, relaying that Bishop’s initial question was inherently flawed due to the author’s general disinterest in the digital,as well as a focus—perhaps due to her position as an art historian—on mainstream contemporary art, or the kind of art that is known to valuethe material and tactileover the immaterial. It was an impassioned plea for new media, and the kind of response that elicited further dialoguefrom Bishop. Cornell and Ed Halter’s anthologyMass Effect: Art and the Internet in the Twenty-First Centurycontains Bishop’s original essay “Digital Divide” as well as a follow-up essay commissioned by the volume’s editors titled “Sweeping, Dumb, and Aggressively Ignorant!Revisiting ‘Digital Divide’”.2Aside from “digital divide” as a way of demarcating those who have access to technology and those who do not and framing it as a race and class-based issue, Bishop’s digital divide takes place solely in the realm of art; perhaps situating it as a specifically art-based issue is its biggest problem.  It is not as cut-and-dry as whether or not new media art does x, y, or z like its analog predecessors, but moreso about the nuances that make it seem so unapproachable or uninteresting to those, like Bishop,committed to the so-called canon of art historical importance that privileges a very specific notion of form and technicality accomplished by pen or brush to canvas. Code—whether painstakingly composedby its author or manipulated through a program—asks for new ways of feeling through occupying digital space,and allows for an alternative replication of emotion and feeling that is typically accessedthrough figures, or occasionally the lack thereof, in modern and postmodern art practice.However,in many instances,interacting with a work that utilizes digital media in anycapacity beseeches the viewer to stay with it for a duration of time; a digital painting might elicit doubt that it was painted using a brush and not a tablet, for example. While largely placing the blame on the editors at Artforum, Bishop admitted that she chose to trade an emphasis on the specter of technology that looms over works of art produced after 1989 for the idea that new media art was part of a “niche (like many others) with its own star system, discourse, and structures of dissemination.”4Although the following sections touch uponthe shortcomingsofBishop’s initial argument, my interest in the sensuality of new media and its presentation in digital and physical spaces is explicated in a tripartite thematic division prompted by my thesis project. Naturally,reflecting upon the exhibition that took place in January of 2018, as well expanding upon the underlying concepts that formed and shaped it,is important for my curatorial practice. Beginningwith this exhibition, whichincludedthree artists with differing practices who allusethe Internet and digital media to inform their works, as a case study, my initial thesis that a form of emotional labor takes place when interacting with the network (the network as it underlines and shapes the Internet)—especially as a woman—inspiredmore rhetorical questions than actual answers or conclusions. This is another theme of the followingtext: Being that the nature of acuratorial practice has become more of an exploration of the unknowable, the unanswerable; many of my own thoughts concerning the research I have been doing have cropped up in the form of fragments or vignettes, yet I have come upon a general ideaof the most pertinent thematic inquiries to continue pursuing in the future. For instance, the Internet’s relationship with the networkhasproduced countless artworks that either respond to that relationship or treat it purely as a medium or an arbitrary means of reaching another conclusion. I initially leaned on Alexander Galloway’s definition of the network from the anthologyCritical Terms for Media Studies(his definition of the network has varied largely from this particular example)to further devisewhat the network—and the Internet—even is as a concept; he likened it metaphorically to chaos and ruin.5As poetic as this is, I later found Tiziana Terranova to have a much more nuanced idea of the interrelationship between the networks and the Internet, speaking to it as:[...] a network of networks, or an internetwork, a topological formation that presents some challenging insights into the dynamics underlying the formation of a global network culture. As a technical system, the Internet consists of a set of interrelated protocols, abstract technical diagrams that give the network consistency beyond the rapidly changing hardware environment of computers, servers, cable and wires.6This confluence of the two concepts speaks to information and communication; Terranova does not specifically speak to art practice, but it rightly figures into the exchanges of creativity between bodies. Encountering another body online through language or image is incredibly unique to the Internet, allowing us akind of freedom to express emotions through the likes of code, messaging services, and blogging, among others. Wendy Hui Kyong Chun recently posited that new media is under constant renovation; the interconnectedness of the Internet, and in turn, the network, does not quite promote collectivity among its users, instead opting for an emphasis on the individual. She creates a more-relevant term for new media, writing: “The NOW constantly punctures time, as the new quickly becomes old, and the old becomes forwarded once more as new(ish). New media are N(YOU) media; new media are a function of YOU.”7It is possible that this theorization of new media as a subjective media transcends the tendency of art theory and criticism to “other”art discourses that appear to be broad or even generally hard to define. Seth Price’s Dispersion takes the form of a hybridized theory-practice artwork that is hard to categorize, and upon further review, what makes new media so exciting as a means to situate works that underline interdisciplinary methods.It is an essay rooted in art historythat pertinently speaks to new media as a constant cycling-through of the old and the new, yet it is crystalized permanently online as a PDFthat was originally designed in Adobe InDesign.Price’s conversation regarding distributed media mirrors the ongoing conversation around distributed networks akin to Terranova and Chun’s, and the project’s execution as an essay (that employs language in the form of vignettes)utilizes language to speak to media—in whichever way it records and is recorded—and its ability to be a “mode of production analogous not to the creation of material goods, but to the production of social contexts.”8Although Dispersionexists as a booklet and was physically integratedin Price’s exhibition at Reena Spaulings Fine Art,its context within and around conceptual art directly feeds into the malleabilityallowed by new media works and, in its initial execution, prompts the following discussion aroundelements of new media artworks."

            "output": "While materialism, community, and the archive have been used to re-inscribe and re-characterize new media works through the scope of the art institution, they have also thematically characterized the Internet itself as a relevant artistic tool that is constantly reimagining the future of art practice. Curatorial practice functions as a site,of sorts,akin to the Internet; it tries to renegotiate the role of the institution(in this specific reference, the white cube)in favoring or decrying vast swaths of artworks which very well funnel into the art market itself. According to Boris Groys: [...] every curatorial project has the goal of contradicting the previous, traditional art-historical narratives. If such a contradiction does not take place, the curatorial project loses its legitimacy. An individually curated exhibition that merely reproduces and illustrates the already known narratives simply does not make any sense.49I agree with thisstatement;however, exhibitions continue to function within the realm of the “already known,” further continuing the legacy of the art institution as merely supplementaryto the depths of art practices, and my investigation of the waysnew media has been working against this legacy through its material and experiential makeup is,and will be,a continuing research project. Is it possible that acquiescing to the inevitability of the Internet as a crucial part of curatorial and artistic practice within and around the institution could inspire more interesting future projects? LaTurbo Avedon, an artist whopurports to exist solelyas a nonbinary avatar online, has curatedthe online project Panther Modern—a constantly-evolving architectural mock-up of a structure that will never exist in the real world—since 2013.Avedon encourages artists to inhabit a proposed three-dimensional space that canadd on to this speculative institutional space.50As of this writing, the site houses sixteen unique artist’s projects as “rooms,” which range from interactive (likeannotated YouTubecontent) to scrollable images. Avedon’s project, though currently on hold, imagines the institution as a completely habitable website, assuming that the domain name is renewed promptly and the serverfunctions properly.The body—the self—is “multiple, fluid, and constituted in interaction with machine connections; it is made and transformed by language [...].”51It allows artists like Avedon to retain relative anonymity while conducting ambitious products with likeminded artists. It feels and reacts to works online and offline, but more-so when in control of driving the narrative forward. I click the arrow to go back to a prior page when I think I have “killed” the already-doomed Mouchette; being confronted with the responses of the users who had gone through this trajectory already, responding to her morose questions, makesme question if what I seeon the screen is final (even if she is not a “real” girl). Digital and networked projectsthat operate under Manovich’s baselinedefinition of what constitutes new media artelicit this strange otherworldly empathy through tactility; it is possible that these works possessa form ofBarthes’ punctum, that instinctual detail that establishes a connection with the viewer. I believe this it is still necessary for the punctum to remain a possibility in the physical institutional space, with its promise of forming a relationshipbetween the bodies within itsaudience and the implied intimate relationship betweenthe body and the computer."
