            "output": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition affecting 1 out of every 44 children in the US today (Maenner  et  al.,  2021).  Autism  is  behaviorally  defined by the  presence  of  two  core  symptom domains: social-communicationchallenges  and  restricted/repetitive  patterns  of  behaviors  and interests  (RRBs) (APA,  2013).  In  order  to  receive  a  diagnosis  of  autism,  an  individual  must sufficiently exhibit symptoms from both these groups (APA, 2013). The  first  domain, social-communicationchallenges,  comprises  different  aspects of  social interaction including socio-emotional reciprocity, use of non-verbal communication methods and forming  and  maintaining  relationships.  Impairment  must  be  evident  in  each  of  these  areas  in order  to  receive  a  diagnosis  of  autism.  The  second  domain,  RRBs,  refers  to  several  types  of behaviors  including  stereotypical  movements  and  object  use,  insistence  on  sameness,  highly-focused areas of interest and sensory hypo/hyper reactivity. Autism  symptoms  present  differently  within  different  individuals.  Specifically,  they  rangewidelyin their severity level, i.e., in how impactful they are on the person’s everyday behavior. Some  individuals  experience  substantial social-communicationdifficulties  and/or  many  and severe forms of RRBs. For others, however, these symptoms are less apparent and less restricting in their everyday interactions and life. In order to help clinicians evaluate the presence of core symptoms in an individual’s behavior, standardized assessment measures have been developed (Waizbard-Bartov  &  Miller,  2023).  These  tools  provide  a  standardized  measure  for  assessing autism  symptoms,  based  on  predetermined  thresholds  for  symptom  severity  levels  that  likely meet criteria to receive an autism diagnosis (Yu, Ozonoff, & Miller, 2023). One such tool is the Autism  Diagnostic  Observation  Schedule (Lord  et  al.,  2000;  C.    Lord  et  al.,  2012),  or  ADOS, considered the gold standard assessment measure for direct observation of autism symptoms. The  ADOS  is  a  semi-structured  social  interaction  that  creates  opportunities  for the  assessor to evaluate the presence of core symptoms in the individual’sbehavior. Itincludes five  modules, each adapted forindividuals of a specific age and language ability, from Pre-Verbal/Single wordsup  to Fluent  Speech. The  ADOS  produces both raw  scores  for  symptom  levels  as  well  as standardized comparison scores (the Calibrated Severity Scores; CSS)(Gotham, Pickles, & Lord, 2009).  The  CSS  range  from  1  (least  severe)  to  10  (most  severe)  and  are  used  to  quantify  the severity  level  of  core  symptoms  as evident  in  the  assessment.  In  addition to the total  CSS,  the ADOS also produces standardized scores to evaluate social-communicationchallenges (SA CSS) and  RRBs  (RRB  CSS),  separately (Hus,  Gotham,  &  Lord,  2014).  Because  these  are  standardized scores,  they  enable  comparison  of  symptom  severity  levels  between  different  individuals  and within specific individuals over time. Longitudinal  studies  have  used  the  ADOS  CSS  repeatedly  across  measurements  to  try  and understand if autism core symptoms remain stable, or rather change, across the life span. Many studies have indicated that autism symptoms tend to remain stable over time, identifying very large groups of individuals, between 80%-90% across samples, that remain stable in the severity of their core symptoms over time (Gotham, Pickles, & Lord, 2012; Venker, Ray-Subramanian, Bolt, & Ellis Weismer, 2014). Other studies, however, have emphasized change in symptom severity. For instance, Fountain, Winter, and Bearman (2012)found that, in a very large sample (N=6975), most children showed significant change in symptom severity from age 3 to 14. While this study did  not  utilize  standardized  assessment  tools  for  autism  symptoms  (but  rather  a  parent interview), it has the power of having a very large sample size. Another longitudinal study using the   Autism   Diagnostic   Interview-Revised   (ADI-R), (Lord,   Rutter,   &   Le   Couteur,   1994),   a standardized parent  interviewfor  autism  symptoms,  found  that  symptoms  tended  to  either change or remain stable in severity across time, to almost equal proportions across individuals in their  sample (Shattuck  et  al.,  2007).  For  participants  who  did  experience  change  (46%), decreasing severity (26%) was more common than increasing severity (20%), yet both types of change  occurred  within  the  sample.  Collectively,these  studies  indicate  that  some  individuals change  in the  severity  of their  core  symptoms  over time,  to either  increase  or decrease, while others  remain  stable,  and  it  is  not  clear  what  proportions  of  individuals  experience  change compared to symptom stability.   To further complicate things, studies identifying change in symptom severity have shown that it is not consistent within individuals overtime. Severity change can differ in:(a) when it occurs during  development  (periods  of  stability  compared  to  periods  of  change  within anindividual) (Georgiades et al., 2021); (b)the direction of change (decreasing compared to increasing severity) (Clark,   Barbaro,   &   Dissanayake,   2017); and (c) the   rate   at   which  change   occurs   (e.g., fast/moderate change, consistent pace/slowing with time) (Georgiades, Bishop, & Frazier, 2017; Taylor & Seltzer, 2010). Thus, symptom severity change may manifest differently across various developmental periods. Changein  autism  symptoms  is  also  characterized  by  differences  between  the  two  core domains  comprising  it (Fountain  et  al.,  2012).  Evidence  suggests that social-communicationchallenges tend  todecrease  in  severity  with  age (Bal,  Kim,  Fok,  &  Lord,  2019;  Fountain  et  al., 2012; Lord, Bishop, & Anderson, 2015), while RRBs have been found to either decrease (Shattuck et al., 2007), increase (Lord et al., 2015)or remain stable over time (Gillespie-Lynch et al., 2012). This difference in the tendency for severity change, as well as which type of change occurs, can impact  our  ability to understand  change  in the severity  of  overall  autism  symptoms  (using the ADOS total symptom severity score), as well as separately foreachdomain. The  three  types  of  differences  described  above  (between-person,  within-person-over-time and  across-symptom-domains)  make  change  in  autism  symptom  severity  extremely  variable (Georgiades et al., 2017). Moreover, at the individual level, these differences make it very hard to try and predict if and how a person’score symptom severity will change overtime. Yet, there may  be  additional  factors  that  can  assist  when  attempting  to  make  such  a  prediction. Autistic individualsoftenface other,  co-occurring  challenges inaddition  to  those  brought  on  by  core symptoms (Mutluer   et   al.,   2022).   These   includeneurodevelopmental   and mental  health challengessuch as  ADHD, anxiety, aggressive behaviors and depression (Lai et al., 2019; Simonoff et  al.,  2008),intellectual  disability(Maenner  et  al.,  2021;  Solomon  et  al.,  2018),  languagedisorders (Schaeffer et al., 2023), sleep problems (Chen et al., 2021), gastrointestinal symptoms(Reynolds  et  al.,  2021),  epilepsy (Karunakaran  et  al.,  2020)and  others.  Thehigh  prevalence  of suchcomorbidities among autistic individuals suggest that they are a fundamental part of how havingautism impacts a person’s everyday life (Waizbard-Bartov, Fein, Lord, & Amaral, 2023a). In  addition,  these  co-occurring  challenges  as  well  as  other  developmental  and  environmental factors also interact with and influence change in core symptom levels throughout the life span.  For  instance,  being  a  girl  has  been  associated  with  a  stronger  tendency  to  decrease  in  the severity of core symptoms during early childhood compared to being a boy (Szatmari et al., 2015). Decreasing in autism symptom severity has also been linked with having average-range IQ;i.e., not havingintellectual disability (Fein et al., 2013; Georgiades et al., 2021; Gotham et al., 2012; Woodman, Smith, Greenberg, & Mailick, 2015). In contrast, toddlers with developmental delays as well as preschool-aged children who are minimally verbal or have speech delays are less likely to  decrease  in  core  symptom  severity,  especially in  the  domain  ofsocial-communication challenges (Bal et al., 2019; Hinnebusch, Miller, & Fein, 2017). Adaptive functioning has also been associated  with  change  in  core  symptom  severity (Charman  et  al.,  2011;  Gotham  et  al.,  2012; Perry, Flanagan, Dunn Geier, & Freeman, 2009), though not consistently (Kim, Macari, Koller, & Chawarska,  2016;  Szatmari  et  al.,  2015),  making  this  potential  relationship  a  target  for  further investigation. Co-occurring mental health challenges may also impact change in core symptom severity.  Dealing  with  comorbidities  such  as  anxiety  has  been  associated  with  increasing symptom severity (Baribeau et al., 2022), while decreasing levels of mental health problemsis associated  with  marked  decreases  in  core  symptom  levels(Orinstein  et  al.,  2015).  Finally,  the literature shows individuals’ initial symptom severity levels at the time of diagnosis is not necessarily a good predictor of future change in core symptom levels (Bal et al., 2019; Pellicano, Cribb, & Kenny, 2019; Sutera et al., 2007). Environmental  factors  have also been  linked  with  change  in  core  symptom  levels  during childhood. Sociodemographic factors may impact children’s change, and especially the tendency for severity increase. Living in an impoverished neighborhood (Simonoff et al., 2019), having less educated parents,and coming from lower socioeconomic status (Fountain et al., 2012)have all been  associated  with  increasing  symptom  severity  or  with  having  a  lower  likelihood  for decreasing  severity (Fountain  et  al.,  2012;  Georgiades  et  al.,  2021). It  is  unclear  whether children’s intervention history is associated with their symptom severity trajectories. While early intervention   has   been   established   as beneficialfor   young   children   on   the   spectrum (Zwaigenbaum  et  al.,  2015),  some  studies  have  found  no  relationship  between  intervention history and severity change (Giserman-Kiss & Carter, 2019; Gotham et al., 2012). Evaluating the literatureto date, is not clear how common change in the severity of autism symptoms over timeis. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that once change does occur, it is not linear in nature but rather can differ across development. We still do notyetunderstand, however,what  characterizes  different  developmental  periods  in  relation  to varioustypes  of severity  change.  The  literature  consistently  shows  that  the  two  symptom  domains, social-communicationchallenges  and  RRBs,  have  different  developmental trajectories over time. Buthow  they  change  in  relation  to  each  other  and their  differentialimpactonthe  total  autism symptom trajectory ofan individualare not clear. Finally, both developmental and environmental factorsimpact individuals’ core symptom trajectories over time, making it crucial to understand what defineschildren who  either  increase,  decrease  or  remain  stable  in  their  symptom  levels. Understanding thecharacteristics of thechildrenwhose symptoms change over timeis important to  our  understanding both of  longitudinal  trajectories in  autism and  how trajectoriesimpact outcomes. This understanding can help us to better provide supports that promotedecreases in core symptom levels andprevent potential increasesover time,and to identify those who are at risk for other challenges (e.g., mental health) allowing for earlier intervention for these difficulties as well. In the following set of studies, I evaluated change in the severity of core symptoms for the children of the University of California, Davis MIND Institute’s Autism Phenome Project (APP) and Girls with Autism Imaging of Neurodevelopment (GAIN) studies. I sought to answer the following fourquestions: 1.Do the core symptoms of autism change in severity over time? And if so, how common is change? 2.Does symptom severity change differ between periods of development? How is change characterized over time? 3.Does change in symptom severity differ between the two core domains? How do these impact change in total autism symptom severity level? 4.What developmental and environmental factors characterize children that either increase or decrease in symptom severity across childhood?"
