            "output": "In  this  chapter,  the  topic  of  exploration  is  cathode-directed  pulsed  nanosecond  discharge(PND) ignition,  in which a pair of electrodes in a combustion chamber receive a series oflarge and fast voltage pulses.  As mentioned in Chapter 2, this increases the reduced electricfieldE/nbetween  the  electrodes,  pushing  electrons  from  the  anode  to  the  ground  cath-ode through narrow (∼100μm) channels henceforth referred to asstreamers(Ono and Oda,2003).  These electrons are at much higher temperatures than the neutral molecules and ions,forming a non-thermal plasma (Fridman, 2008c) and activating alternative kinetic pathwaysto  facilitate  the  ignition  of  dilute  fuel-air  mixtures  (Starikovskaia,  2006;  Starikovskiy  andAleksandrov, 2013; Ju and Sun, 2015; Aleksandrov et al., 2009).  As discussed in Chapter 2,the chemical kinetics of these alternative ignition pathways are a topic of active research andmany mechanisms have been proposed for a variety of reduced electric field regimes (Alek-sandrov  et  al.,  2009;  Kosarev  et  al.,  2008;  Uddi  et  al.,  2009;  Bisetti  and  El  Morsli,  2012;Adamovich et al., 2015; DeFilippo and Chen, 2016).  However, compounding hydrodynamiceffects from a pulsed discharge in breakdown regimes poses issues for practical ignition inautomotive engines, which must operate at a variety of dilution, speeds, and loads, corre-sponding to a large range of mixtures, residence times, and ignition pressures, respectively.As  mentioned  in  Chapter  2,  various  PND  systems  have  been  observed  to  improve  theperformance and extend the dilute operating limits of internal combustion engines (Catheyet  al.,  2007;  Shiraishi  et  al.,  2009;  Pancheshnyi  et  al.,  2014;  Tropina  et  al.,  2016).   Re-cently,  some  of  these  systems—in  conjunction  with  novel  electrode  geometries—have  alsobeen shown to reduce flame development times in engines using both E85 (Sj ̈oberg et al.,2014) and gasoline (Sevik et al., 2016), leading to improved dilute operation performance.  Inthe E85 investigation, high-speed (20 kHz) imaging inside of the cylinder suggests that thedeveloping flame kernel is jettisoned into the combustion chamber.  The turbulent flow fieldinside of the engine precludes a definite conclusion as to why this jettison effect occurs, and somore fundamental experiments are needed to explain the combustion enhancement.  Thoughthere have been many experimental investigations of PND ignition in constant volume cham-bers, most utilize relatively simple electrode geometries such as plate electrodes (Aleksandrovet al., 2009; Kosarev et al., 2008; Uddi et al., 2009; Kosarev et al., 2016; Nagaraja et al.,2013), concentric electrodes (Singleton et al., 2011), or pin-to-pin electrodes (Lovascio et al.,2017) with which convenient numerical model comparisons can be made (Takana et al., 2014;Castela et al., 2016).  Few experiments have been carried out to characterize the physics ofcombustion  enhancement  observed  in  the  types  of  electrodes  expected  to  be  used  in  au-tomotive  engines,  for  which  modeling  investigations  are  hindered  by  the  large  separationbetween  non-thermal  plasma  and  hydrodynamic  timescales.   This  short  study  documentshydrodynamic aspects of PND ignition in lean premixed methane-air mixtures and providesan explanation for the enhancements seen in the aforementioned engine experiments."

            "output": "During the brewing process, Saccharomyces cerevisiaeconverts the fermentable sugars from grains into ethanol and a host of other flavor-determining by-products. Flowers of the hop plant, Humulus lupulusL., are typically added during the wort boil to impart bitter flavor and immediately before or during the fermentation to impart “hoppy” flavor and fragrance (Figure 2.2). Over the last two decades, consumers have displayed an increasing preference for beers that contain hoppy flavor. Hops are an expensive ingredient for breweries to source (total domestic sales have tripled over the last 10 years due to heightened demand) and a crop that requires a large amount of natural resources: ~100 billion L of water is required for annual irrigation of domestic hops and considerable infrastructure is required to deliver water from its source to the farm45,46. Further, hops vary considerably in essential oil content, making it challenging to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer.Hop flowers are densely covered by glandular trichomes, specialized structures that secrete secondary metabolites into epidermal outgrowths47. These secretions accumulate as essential oil, which is rich in various terpenes, the class of metabolites that impart hoppy flavor to beer. Considerable research has investigated which of these molecules are primarily responsible for this flavor48; these studies are complicated by genetic, environmental, and process-level variation49and have suggested that the bouquet of flavor molecules contributed to beer by hops is complex. Nonetheless, the two monoterpene molecules linalool and geraniol have been identified as primary flavor determinants by several sensory analyses of hop extract aroma50–52and finished beer taste and aroma51,53–55and together, they are major drivers of the floral aroma of Cascade hops53, the most widely used hop in American craft brewing56. Previous metabolic engineering efforts have achieved microbial monoterpene biosynthesis in various microbial hosts. Work in a domesticated wine yeast has demonstrated the feasibility of producing monoterpene compounds by biosynthesis in yeast by overexpression of a geraniol synthase from a high-copy plasmid propagated in selective media57. However, engineering genetically stable, controlled, precise production of a combination of specific flavorants in any industrial food-processing agent has remained a formidable challenge.In this work, we create drop-in brewer’s yeast strainscapable of biosynthesizing monoterpenes that give rise to hoppy flavor in finished beer, without addition of flavor hops. To achieve this end, we identify genes suitable for monoterpene biosynthesis in yeast; we develop methods to overcome the difficulties associated with stable integration of large constructs in industrial strains; we adapt genetic tools to generate a collection of engineered industrial yeast strains on an unprecedented scale; we develop computational methods to affect precise biosynthetic control and leverage them to create a iterative framework towards target production levels. Ultimately, sensory analysis performed with beer brewed in pilot industrial fermentations demonstrates that engineered strains confer hoppy flavor to finished beer."

            "output": "Engineering is a global profession.  Current and future engineers will need to work together to combat global climate change, consider the sustainable development of less-developed regionsof the world, and even explore space (Grandin & Hirleman, 2009).  Additionally, the outsourcing of jobs and global sales may require that engineers be called upon to move abroad.  To succeed, engineers must feel comfortable in cultures other than their own.   Despite the global nature of the profession, engineers in America have been characterized as lacking vital cross-cultural skills (Blumenthal & Grothus, 2009; Jesiek, Zhu, Woo, Thompson, & Mazzurco, 2014).  University preparation in global competency is limited: incorporating such preparation into the undergraduate engineering curriculum is difficult due to the highly structured curriculum and sequential coursework.  The challenge of giving undergraduate engineers a global experience is reflected in the number of engineering majors nationally who study abroad: less than 5% of all undergraduates who studied abroad in the 2013-2014 school year were engineering majors (IIE, 2015a).  In order to increase participation, some universities have begun to create global engineering programs that will prepare undergraduate engineers for global work.  These programs include coursework in global issues, increased opportunities for international interaction on campus, and enhancement of study abroad opportunities specifically for engineers. This study sought to explore one aspect of global engineering education: study abroad.  The rationale for engineering majors to go abroad is clear: Allan E. Goodman, President and CEOof the Institute for International Education(IIE), notes that “innovation and job growth require individuals to possess the capacity to think and act on a global basis, and ... there’s no faster path to this skill set than study abroad” (Goodman, 2009, p. 6).  However, do engineering majors who do study abroad feel they develop “the capacity to think and act on a global basis” as a result of their study abroad experience?  What outcomes do they self-report?  These and other questions were explored in this study. "

            "tl;dr": "",         
            "abstract": "Extensive literature on study abroad outcomes documents the benefits of study abroad for all undergraduate students, regardless of academic major.  However, engineering majors, at 5% of all undergraduate students nationally who study abroad, are substantially less likely to study abroad than their social science peers, at 17.3% participation (IIE, 2016).  Yet engineering majors have much to gain from international experiences: engineering is a global profession, and these future engineers will be expected not only to work in diverse teams but also travel and work abroad.  The purpose of this study is: (a)to explore the goals, motivations and challenges or barriers that undergraduate engineering majors face in their decision-making regarding study abroad, particularly in comparison to those motivations and barriers identified in the literature;(b) to identify outcomes of study abroad for this group of students and how they believe study abroad might impact their future; and (c) to explore students’ decision-making regardingengineering study abroad from academic advisors’ perspectives.These advisors not only support undergraduates’ academic needs on campus but also help them plan for study abroad. The theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Azjen, 1975) andtransformational learning theory (Mezirow, 1991) formed the theoretical framework for this study.  Combined, these theories form the basis of a conceptual model to explain the decision-making process of studying abroad and how study abroad can be a transformative learning experience for study abroad participants.This study employed a mixed methods methodology (Creswell, 2014) to address the research questions.  First, a survey was sent to engineering undergraduates who had participated in study abroad at 8 different undergraduate institutionswithin a university system.  Then, based on survey responses, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 of the survey participants.  Concurrently, 7 academic advisors were interviewed in order to shed light on the advising process for engineering majors to study abroad.   Personal and institutional factors were found to be the primary considerations in deciding whether to study abroad.Personal factors included students’ desires forcultural experiences and their internal driveto overcome any obstacles they faced.  Institutionally, curriculum restrictions for engineering majors and student fearsabout delay in graduationchallenged study abroad participation.  Outcomes included students’ alteration of career plans, increasing their insight into other cultures, and increasing their comfort with working abroad.",

            "output": "We studied human and wildlife activity in and around the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL; N 38.9585336,W 106.9899337)overa five-week period in June-August2020. This data collection period captured the start of peak tourism season to examine varying levels of human visitation. We surveyed mammalian activitynear hiking and biking trails by placing camera traps along trails. We quantified how humans influencedthe habitat use of mid-sized and large mammals as a function of human visitation rate and activity type with occupancy models to estimatespecies occupancy while correcting for imperfect detection(Mackenzie et al. 2002; Bailey and Adams 2005).We included five hiking and biking trails in this study: Deer Creek(N 38.945534, W 106.981061), Trail 401(N 38.964142, W 106.988587), Trail 403(N 38.982264, W 107.007438), Kettle Ponds Road(N 38.953452, W 106.988142), and Avery Mountain(N 38.966412, W 106.993313). This setincludes trails that are frequently used for allactivities, trails that are off limits to bikers, trails that are infrequently visited and only by hikers, and wide trails with motorized vehicle access.This site presents an excellent opportunity to study wildlife habitat use near trails with varying activities and heterogeneous impact intensities.The shortest trail, Kettle Ponds Road, is approximately 1500 m long, so we placed cameras along the first 1500 m of each trail to standardizethe camera spacing among all the trails. We used a total of 30 cameras, placing six cameras on each of the five trails using a stratified random design to ensure every portion of each trail was studied throughout the study period (Fig. 1).Each 1500 m trail segment was divided into six zones, each of which contained one camera. Each zone was divided into six subsections, and every week one subsection was randomly selected in each zone for the camera to be deployed for seven days. At the end of a seven-day deployment period, each camera was moved to a new, randomly selected subsection within its original zone for the next deployment. Each subsection was used only once during the entire study period.We used digital camera traps (Browning Strike Force ModelBTC-5HDPX, Prometheus Group, LLC, Birmingham, Alabama, USA)to record human and wildlife activity on the trails in the study area. The motion-triggered cameras captured still images when a human, animal, or vehiclemoved in front of them, with a delay of one second between photos.The cameras also recorded the date and time that each photo was taken, and this information was later used to create species detection histories. For each deployment we recorded the height of the tallest vegetation between the camera and the trail in its view to account for the potential for tall vegetation to obscure small animals from the camera’s view.Cameras were considered non-operational if the batteries died, the SD card became too full to store any additionalphotos, or the camera fell and was no longer facing the trail. We also discarded the camera-days where cattle were present as the impacts of cattle ranching on wildlife was beyond the scope of this study.The short delay of one second between photos allowed for the collection of detailed photo sequences, often with multiple photos representing a single visit. We processed the resulting image dataset by saving one image to represent each “capture,” or one individual person,animal, or vehicleat one time. Acapture starts when an individual enters the camera’s view, and it ends when that individual leaves the camera’s view and is absent from the next photo. Each sequence of photos was examined to determine the number of captures in the sequence. The number of captures of each species denotesthe number of times the cameras were triggered by activity.This method countsindividualseach separate time they pass in front of the camera, which represents the amount of activity at the site rather than the number ofunique individuals.All wildlife sightingswere identified to species using all available clueswithin the photo sequences, including body size, body features, color patterns, and fur textures.Four wildlife species were sufficiently common to createoccupancy models: mule deer(Odocoileus hemionus), coyotes(Canis latrans), red foxes(Vulpes vulpes), and black bears(Ursus americanus). The metadata of the scored photos wasused tocreate presence-absence detection histories for each of the four focal speciesin the Rprogramming language v4.1.0(R Core Team 2021) usingthe package camtrapR (Niedballaet al. 2016).The detection histories were then used to run single-species, single-season occupancy models for each of the four focal species(Mackenzie et al. 2006). We fittedoccupancy models in the R package unmarked(Fiske and Chandler 2011).The primary period, or “season,”(Mackenzie et al. 2006)for the occupancy framework was seven days long as each camera was deployed for seven days before being movedto start a new deployment. The secondary period, or “survey,” (Mackenzie et al. 2006) was one day, meaning thepresence or absence of a species or activity was measured on a daily basis.Detectability is represented on a daily scale and occupancy is represented on a seasonal scale.We calculated the number of captures of each human activity per day and used these daily captures as predictor variables in the detection formulas of the models. We replaced missing values with deployment mean valueswherever predictor variables were missing values due to camera operability problems. We then calculated the seven-day averages ofdaily captures of each activity at each site to use as seasonal predictor variablesin the occupancy formulas of the models. We standardized all continuous predictor variables, which included survey-level covariates: pedestrians(ped), bikers(biker), and motorized vehicles(vehicle);seasonalcovariates: site-averaged pedestrians (avg.ped), site-averaged bikers (avg.biker), and site-averaged motorized vehicles (avg.vehicle);as well as distance from the trailhead(scale.distance), understory vegetation height(scale.veg), and Julian day of the start of each deployment (start.jday.scale). We tested for multicollinearity among the human predictor variables and found that pedestrians and dogs were highly correlated (r > 0.9). Therefore we excludeddog datafrom the models. There were very few horseback riders in the data set, and since we did not expect themto be a major driver of habitat usepatterns in this system, we excluded equestrian datatoavoid over-fittingthe models. We included human activities as covariates in both the detectabilityformulas and the occupancy formulasin accordance with our hypotheses. The occupancy formula testswhether the covariate has an effect on the presence or absence of the species. The detectability formula tests whether a covariate causes the species to be easier or harder to detect. We includedhuman covariates inthe detectability formula to testwhether the focal species weremore visible or secretive at higher levels of human activity. We used daily count data for the detectability covariates and seasonal averages of the count data for the occupancy covariates. We hypothesizedthat trailheads have more human activity than farther along the trails, and we expected that proximity to the trailhead could affect species occupancy. Therefore we included a variable accounting for the distance from the trailhead in the occupancy formula.We expected that focal species’ predators or prey could affect occupancy. We therefore included predators (coyotes, black bears, and mountain lions) in the deer model (avg.pred) and prey in the coyote, fox, and bear models. For bears and coyotes, the “avg.prey” variable included all detections of deer, elk, marmots, and hares combined. For foxes, the “avg.prey.fox” variable included only marmots and hares.We recognize that both coyotes and foxes eat smaller mammals as well as birds at our study site.We included the understoryvegetation height variable in the detectability formula for its potential todecrease probability of detection, especially for smaller animals. We also included the Julian day variable, which represents the first Julian day of each deployment, because animals may change their activity patterns throughout the year.We included trail as a random effect in the occupancy formula to account for potential differences among the five trails studied.We included this random effect in every model we tested. We tested random effects in the occupancy models using the R package TMB (Kristensen et al. 2016). We used the following full modelfor the model selection process:p ~ ped + biker + vehicle + scale.veg + start.jday.scaleΨ ~ avg.ped + avg.biker + avg.vehicle + scale.distance + [avg.pred or avg.prey or avg.prey.fox] + (1 | Trail)We used a two-step model selection approach(Mackenzie et al. 2006):we first tested all possible combinations of covariates in the detectability formulausing full occupancy formulas andfound the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Then we used the lowest AIC detectability formula to test all combinations of covariates in the occupancy formula. This approach involved testing a total of 64 models for each species(listed in supplementary materials). The lowest AIC model resulting from the second step was considered the “best” model for a given species. For the black bear models, seven models in step two did not converge. We provided these models with starting values,and one of them converged while the other six still did not converge. We discarded the six models that did not converge afterbeing given starting values. Site occupancy of unmarked species can be estimated with an occupancy model framework, but the model assumptions are often violated in camera trap studies(Mackenzie et al. 2006). In this study, the model assumption that sites are “closed” (site occupancy does not change during the survey period) is violated because the home ranges of the species in this study are likely larger than the distance between the cameras. Therefore, the model output isinterpreted as habitat use, the probability that a site is used by a species, rather than the probability of occupancy (Mackenzie et al. 2006; Burton et al. 2015; Gould et al. 2019). All cameras were deployed along trails; therefore the resulting models can be used to make inferences about habitat use and detectability around these trails."

            "output": "Cloning. All strains, expression plasmids, and additional plasmids used for strain construction are listed and described in Supplementary Tables 4-9. The sequence files corresponding to each plasmid can be found in the JBEI Public Registry (https://public-registry.jbei.org/)89. Plasmids were propagated in Escherichia colistrain DH10B and purified by Miniprep (Qiagen, Germantown, MD). The “pathway” plasmids used to construct the engineered brewing strains were assembled by the standard Golden Gate method using type II restriction enzymes and T7 DNA Ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA)72,90(for additional detail, see schematized assembly strategy in Supplementary Fig. 3). All other plasmids generated in this study were constructed by Gibson assembly91using Gibson assembly master mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Constructs were designed using Device Editor bioCAD software92, and assembly primers were generated with j5 DNA assembly design automation software93using the default settings. PCR amplification was performed using PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Takara Bio, Mountain View, CA).Genes coding for full-length linalool and geraniol synthases were ordered either from IDT (San Diego, CA) as G-blocks or from Life Technologies (Carlsbad, CA) as DNA strings. The coding sequences ofheterologous genes in all plasmids were validated by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz, South Plainfield, NJ and Quintara, South San Francisco, CA).Strain construction.Yeast lab strains were transformed by the high efficiency lithium acetate method94. Strains were cultivated in Yeast extract + Peptone + Dextrose (YPD) medium unless otherwise noted. To select for transformants containing auxotrophic complementation cassettes, transformed cells were plated on standard dropout medium (Sunrise Science Products, San Diego, CA). To select for transformants containing drug resistance cassettes, cells were recovered in YPD medium for 4 h after transformation, and then plated on YPD medium supplemented with 200 μg/LGeneticin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or Hygromycin B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).Minor modifications were made to cultivation conditions for brewer’s yeast transformations: pre-transformation cultures were grown in YPD medium supplemented with 200mg/L adenine sulfate at 20°C in glass test tubes with shaking at 200 rpm. A single colony was used to inoculate an initial 5 mL culture, which was grown overnight to turbidity. This culture was used to inoculate a second 5 mL culture to an OD600of 0.01, which was grown for 18 h. The second culture was then used to inoculate 50 mL cultures in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks to OD600of 0.05. After ~8 hours of growth, strains were transformed by the lithium acetate method94, cells were recovered in YPD medium for 4 h, plated on YPD supplemented with 200 μg/L Geneticin, and then grown for 5-7 d at 20°C.DNA used for genomic integration was prepared either by PCR-amplifying plasmid DNA or by digesting a plasmid with restriction enzymes. For construction of the GPP-hyper-producing strain, integration fragments were amplified from the corresponding plasmids by PCR (Supplementary Table 5). For construction of pathway-integrated brewing strains, plasmid DNA was linearized by restriction digestion with NotI-HF and PstI-HF (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) (Supplementary Tables 8and9).All integration events were confirmed by diagnostic PCR using GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI). For brewer’s yeast strains, homozygosity at the integration locus was tested using primers targeted to the 5’ and 3’ junctions of desired allele and the parental allele. The identity of the multi-gene integration was verified with primers targeted to each of the four promoter/gene junctions. Screening synthases.For the linalool and geraniol synthase screening, single colonies were picked from the transformation plate and used to inoculate cultures in 5 mL CSM -Leu (Sunrise)+ 2% raffinose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) medium. After 24 h, the pre-cultures were diluted into fresh CSM -Leu + 2% galactose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) medium to an OD of 0.05 and grown for 72 h with shaking at 200 rpm. An organic overlay was added 24 h after inoculation to capture hydrophobic monoterpenes. Decane was used as the overlay for the cultures expressing linalool synthase and dodecane was used for those expressing geraniol synthase. The overlay was chosen so as to minimize overlap of retention times between solvent and product for subsequent GC/MS analysis. Microaerobic fermentation.Strains were streaked on YPD medium and grown for 2 days at 25°C. Single colonies were used to inoculate initial 2 mL precultures in 24-well plates (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), which were grown for 3 days at 20°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Strains were grown in a base medium composed of 100 g/L malt extract (ME) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Each well contained a 5 mm glass bead (Chemglass Life Sciences, Vineland, NJ). The resulting cultures were used to inoculate second 6 mL precultures in fresh 24-well plates to an OD of 0.1, which were then grown for 3 days at 20°C with shaking at 120 rpm. The resulting cultures were then used to inoculate 25 mL cultures in glass test tubes to an OD of 1.0. These cultures were equipped with a one-way airlock for microaerobic fermentation and grown for 5 days at 20°C. Test tubes were vortexed for 30 s every 24 h. High-performance liquid chromatography.Maltotriose, maltose, glucose, and ethanolwere separated by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and detected by a refractive index (RI) detector. On day 5, fermentation sampleswere centrifuged at 18,000gfor 5 min, filtered using Costar® Spin-X® Centrifuge Tube Filters, 0.22-μm pore, transferred to HPLC tubes, and loaded into an Agilent 1100 HPLC equipped with an Agilent 1200 series auto-sampler, an Aminex HPX-87H ion exchange column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and an Agilent 1200 series RI detector. Metabolites were separated using 4 mM H2SO4aqueous solution with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min at 50°C. Absolute sample concentrations were calculated using a linear model generated from a standard curve composed of authentic maltotriose, maltose, glucose, and ethanol standards (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted in water over a range of 0.2 -20 g/L. All data are provided in Supplementary Table 11.Monoterpene quantification.Monoterpenes were quantified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis, using an Agilent GC system 6890 series GC/MS with Agilent mass selective detector 5973 network. In all experiments, 1 μL of sample was injected (splitless), using He asthe carrier gas onto a CycloSil-B column (Agilent, 30-m length, 0.25-mm inner diameter (i.d.), 0.25-μm film thickness, cat. no. 112-6632). The carrier gas was held at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and EMV mode was set to a gain factor of 1.Sampling,oven temperature schedule, and ion monitoring was optimized for each experiment: for quantifying linalool and geraniol production in terpene synthase screens, the samples were spun down and the organic phase (solvent overlay) was collected, diluted 1:10 in ethyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), transferred to a glass GC vial and injected into the GC column. For samples corresponding to the linalool synthase screen, the oven temperature was held at 50°C for 12 min followed by a ramp of 10°C/min to a temperature of 190°C and a ramp of 50°C/min to a final temperature of 250°C, and then held at 250°C for 1 min. The solvent delay was set to 20 min, and the MS was set to SIM mode for acquisition, monitoring m/zions 80, 93, and 121. For samples corresponding to the geraniol synthase screen, the oven temperature was held at 50°C for 5 min, then ramped at 30°C/min to a temperature of 135°C, then ramped at 5°C/min to a temperature of 145°C, then ramped at 30°C/min to a temperature of 250°C, and held at 250°C for 1 min. The solvent delay was set to 10.8 min and the MS was set to monitor m/zions 69, 93, 111, and 123. For quantifying linalool and geraniol in micro-aerobic fermentations performed with brewer’s yeasts, samples were extracted on day 5 using ethyl acetate. Fermentation samples were collected and spun down, 1600 μL of the supernatant was mixed with ethyl acetate at a 4:1 ratio in a 96-well plate, the plate was sealed and vortexed for 2 min, then spun at 3000gfor 5 min, and 30 μL of the ethyl acetate was transferred into a glass GC vial. The resulting preparation was injected into the GC column. For quantifying linalool and geraniol in various commercial beers, 2 mL of ethyl acetate was added to 8 mL of the beer in glass tubes (Kimble Chase, Rockwood, TN). This was mixed by hand for 2 min and spun at 1000gfor 10 min. 30 μL of the ethyl acetate layer was transferred to glass GC vials, and the resulting preparation was injected into the GC column. For both the micro-aerobic fermentation experiments and sampling of commercial beers, the oven temperature was held at 50°C for 5 min followed by a ramp of 5°C/min to a temperature of 200°C and a ramp of 50°C/min to a final temperature of 250°C, and then held at 250°C for 1 min. The solvent delay was set to 5 minand the MS was set to monitor m/zions 55, 69, 71, 80, 81, 93, 95, 107, 121, 123, and 136.Peak areas for linalool and geraniol were quantified using MSD Productivity ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Absolute sample concentrations were calculated using a linear model generated from a standard curve composed of authentic linalool and geraniol standards (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For monoterpene synthase screening experiments, standards were diluted in ethyl acetate over a range of 0.2 -50 mg/L. For the micro-aerobic fermentation experiments and sampling of commercial beers, standards were spiked into a preparation extracted from the parent strain fermentation sample (i.e. a control preparation used to ensure accurate baseline signal) over a range of 0.2 -10 mg/L. In calculating actual concentrations, apparent concentrations were scaled based on dilution or concentration in GC injection preparation.Proteomics.Protein abundance data are reported in Supplementary Table 12. Culture (5 mL) was sampled after 2 d, vortexed, and spun at 3000gfor 5 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was flash frozen. Plate-based cell pellets were lysed by chloroform-methanol precipitation, described below, while samples in tubes were lysed by re-suspending the pellets in 600 μL of yeast lysis buffer (6 M urea in 500 mM ammonium bicarbonate) followed by bead beating with 500 μL Zirconia/Silica beads (0.5 mm diameter; BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Samples in tubes were bead beat for five cycles of 1 min with 30 s on ice in between each cycle. Subsequently, they were spun down in a benchtop centrifuge at maximum speed for 2 min to pellet cell debris, and the clear lysate was transferred into fresh tubes. Plate-based cell lysis and protein precipitation was achieved by using a chloroform-methanol extraction95. The pellets were re-suspended in 60 μL methanol and 100 μL chloroform, then 50 μL Zirconia/Silica beads (0.5 mm diameter; BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) were added to each well. The plate was bead beat for five cycles of 1 min with 30 s on ice in between each cycle. The supernatants were transferred into a new plate and 30 μL water was added to each well. The plate was centrifuged for 10 min at maximum speed to induce the phase separation. The methanol and water layers were removed, then 60 μL of methanol was added to each well. The plate was centrifuged for another 10 min at maximum speed then the chloroform and methanol layers were removed and the protein pellets were dried at room temperature for 30 min prior to re-suspension in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate with 20% methanol.The protein concentration of the samples was measured using the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) with bovine serum albumin used as a standard. A total of 50 μg protein from each sample was digested with trypsin fortargeted proteomic analysis. Protein samples were reduced by adding tris2-(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) to a final concentration of 5 mM, followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 10 mM toalkylate the protein samples then incubated for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. Trypsin was added at a ratio of 1:50 trypsin:total protein, and the samples were incubated overnight at 37ºC.Peptides were analyzed using an Agilent 1290 liquid chromatography system coupled to an Agilent 6460 QQQ mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The peptide samples (10-20 μg[LC2]) were separated on an Ascentis Express Peptide ES-C18 column (2.7 μm particle size, 160 Å pore size, 5 cm length x 2.1 mm i.d., coupled to a 5 mm x 2.1 mm i.d. guard column with similar particle and pore size; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), with the system operating at a flow rate of 0.400 mL/min and column compartment at 60ºC. Peptides were eluted into the mass spectrometer via a gradient with initial starting condition of 95% Buffer A (0.1% formic acid) and 5% Buffer B (99.9% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). Buffer B was held at 5% for 1.5 min, then increased to 35% B over 3.5 min. Buffer B was further increased to 80% of 0.5 min where it was held for 1 min, then ramped back down to 5% B over 0.3 min where it was held for 0.2 min to re-equilibrate the column to the initial starting condition. The peptides were ionized by an Agilent Jet Stream ESI source operating in positive-ion mode with the following source parameters: Gas Temperature = 250ºC, Gas Flow = 13 L/min, Nebulizer Pressure = 35 psi, Sheath Gas Temperature = 250ºC, Sheath Gas Flow = 11 L/min, VCap = 3,500 V. The data were acquired using Agilent MassHunter, version B.08.00. Resultant data files were processed by using Skyline96version 3.6 (MacCoss Lab, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) and peak quantification was refined with mProphet97in Skyline.Data analysis.Data analysis was performed using the R statistical programming language98. Additional libraries were used for data visualization functionalities99–103. For protein and metabolite analysis heatmaps (Figure 2.5e), relative levels were reported as follows: promoter strengths were represented as a fraction of their previously reported rank order72ranging from PRNR2(0) to PTDH3(1). Feature scaling was used to standardize the range of protein, monoterpene, and sugar abundances. Let siequal the log10-transformed abundance value for species Sin strain i. Normalized values were computed according to equation (1) as:𝑠!′=𝑠𝑖−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑆)𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑆)−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑆)For sugar analysis, unfermented malt extract was included in max/min calculations. For fermentable sugars (i.e. maltotriose, maltose, glucose) the scaled values were subtracted from 1 in order to represent proximity to desired sugar consumption profile. The distance metric of an engineered strain with respect to a given commercial beer was calculated using the Manhattan length as the distance of monoterpene production from beer monoterpene concentrations and the distance in sugar consumption from the parent strain. First, the difference between log10-transformed values of engineered strain monoterpene concentration and target beer monoterpene concentration was calculated for each species, linalool and geraniol. Second, the absolute values of these differences were calculated. Finally, the resulting values, together with the fraction of total sugar remaining after fermentation, were averaged.Mathematical modeling.Three different models were constructed in Python to predict monoterpene production from protein levels (for detailed description and implementation, see Appendix 5.1). Both the Gaussian regressor and linear models were implemented using Scikit Learn104. Additional equations needed to describe the linear model are given in Supplementary Table 3. Equations describing the Michaelis-Menten kinetics model are given in Appendix 5.1. Kinetic parameters were scraped from the literature. Free parameters were included to convert relative protein counts to absolute protein values. Additionally, a parameter β determined the relative ratio between the endogenous FPPS and FPPS*. Both the linear and Gaussian regressor models were fit using standard methods from the Scikit Learn library. The kinetic model was manually constructed without external libraries. To fit the kinetic model, a differential evolution algorithm was used to perform parameter optimization on a nonlinear cost function. Specifically, the sum of the squared residual error of the model predictions from the first iteration strains was minimized with respect to the previously described parameters. The kinetic coefficients were bounded to vary over an order of magnitude from the values described in the literature. In order to cross validate the models and minimize overfitting, a leave-one-out methodology was applied to each model. The error residuals from this cross-validation technique are reported in Supplementary Table 2.Analysis performed for predictingthe extent of performance improvement for second iteration strains (Figure 2.11) compared with randomly designed strains is described in Appendix 5.1.Toxicity assay.OD600measurements were taken in 48-well clear flat bottom plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) using a Tecan Infinite F200 PRO reader, with acquisition every 15 min. Analysis was performed using custom python scripts. Growth curves were calculated by averaging 6 biological replicates; shaded areas represent one standard deviation from the mean. Growth rates were calculated with a sliding window of 5 hours, solving for maximum growth rate. Growth rates are presented as the average of 6 biological replicates; error bars represent 95% confidence intervals (Figure 2.9). Pilot fermentations.Strains were streaked on YPD medium and grown for 2 days at 25°C. Single colonies were used to inoculate initial 5 mL cultures in glass test tubes, which were grown for 2 days at 20°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The resulting cultures were used to inoculate 1 L cultures in 2 L glass Erlenmeyer flasks, which were then grown for 3 days at 20°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Strains were grown in a base medium composed of 100 g/L malt extract (ME) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The resulting cultures were then used to inoculate industrial fermentations in wort produced in a 1.76 hL pilot brewery. For the first set of fermentations, 35 kg of 2-Row malt was milled and added to 105L of DI water treated with 79.15g of brewing salts. Mashing was performed for 30min at 65°C, 10 min at 67°C, and 10 min at 76 °C. The wort was allowed to recirculate for 10min and was separated by lautering. Sparging occurred for 58min, giving a final pre-boil volume in the brew kettle of 215L. The wort was boiled until it reached a final volumeof 197L and a gravity of 11.65 °Plato. Kettle additions included 125g of Magnum hop pellets, 15.1 g of Yeastex yeast nutrients, and 15 g Protofloc (Murphy and Son, Nottingham, United Kingdom). Ingredients were sourced from Brewers Supply Group (Shakopee, MN) except where otherwise noted. After the wort was separated from the hot trub, it was transferred to four 56 L custom fermenters (JVNW, Canby, OR), each filled to 40 L.The beers were fermented at 19°C until they reached terminal gravity, held for an additional 24 hours for vicinal diketone (VDK) removal, and then cold conditioned at 0°C. The length of fermentation, and in turn the length of cold conditioning, was strain dependent. Samples were taken every 24 hours to measure °Platoand pH (Figure 2.13).The resulting beer was filtered under pressure and carbonated prior to storage in 7.75 gallon kegs. Samples were collected during the kegging process for Alcolyzer (Anton Paar, Ashland, VA) analysis (Supplementary Table 13).  For the second set of fermentations, 35 kg of 2-Row malt was milled and added to 105L of DI water treated with 79g of brewing salts. Mashing was performed for 30min at 65°C, 10 min at 67°C, and 10 min at 76 °C. The wort was allowed to recirculate for 10min and was separated by lautering. Sparging occurred for 52min, giving a final pre-boil volume in the brew kettle of 214L. The wort was boiled until it reached a final volume of 194L and a gravity of 11.25 °Plato. Kettle additions included 97.01g of Galena hop pellets, 15.1 gof Yeastex yeast nutrients, and 15 g Protofloc (Murphy and Son, Nottingham, United Kingdom). Ingredients were sourced from Brewers Supply Group (Shakopee, MN) except where otherwise noted. After the wort was separated from the hot trub, it was transferredto four 56 L custom fermenters (JVNW, Canby, OR), each filled to 40 L.The beers were fermented at 19°C until they reached terminal gravity, held for an additional 24 hours for vicinal diketone (VDK) removal, and then cold conditioned at 0°C. The length of fermentation, and in turn the length of cold conditioning, was strain dependent. Samples were taken every 24 hours to measure °Platoand pH (Figure 2.13).After 48 hours at 0°C, 88.5 g Cascade dry hops (either from Washington or from Idaho) were added totwo fermenters containing parent strain WLP001. The dry hops were left on the beer at 1.67°C for 1 week before filtering. The resulting beer was filtered under pressure and carbonated prior to storage in 7.75 gallon kegs. Samples were collected during thekegging process for Alcolyzer (Anton Paar, Ashland, VA) analysis (see Supplementary Table 14).Sensory analysis. Institutional Review Board approval for human research was obtained from the UC Berkeley Office for Protection of Human Subjects (CPHS protocol number 2017-05-9941). The Committee for Protection of Human Subjects reviewed and approved the application under Category 7 of federal regulations. Panelists: sensory analysis of the brewed beer was conducted at Lagunitas Brewing Company (Petaluma, CA).The first panel consisted of 27 employee participants (17 males and 10 females), the second of 13 employee participants (11 males and 2 females), ranging in experience from 2 to 154 tasting sessions attended in calendar year 2017. Ages ranged from mid-20sto 50s. All participants received basic sensory training per Lagunitas standards.Sensory Analysis: samples of 2 ounces were presented in clear 6 oz brandy glasses (Libbey, Toledo, OH). Each panelist received 5 glasses, one control and four samples (one blind control and 3 variables) arranged randomly by balanced block design. Block design and data gathering were accomplished using EyeQuestion® software (Logic8 BV, Netherlands). In a single sitting, panelists were asked to rank hop aroma intensity as compared to the control on a 9-point ordinal scale anchored on one end with “No difference” and the other end with “Extreme difference”. Data Analysis: data were analyzed using Dunnett’s test in conjunction with one-way ANOVA using EyeOpenR® (Logic8 BV, Netherlands). Analysis was performed at the 95% confidence level. The blind control is used as the reference sample to account for any scoring bias that might occur. Dry hopping for evaluation of variation between hop preparations.Parental strain WLP001was streaked on YPD medium and grown for 2 days at 25°C. A single colony was used to inoculate an initial 50 mL preculture in a 250 mL glass Erlenmeyer flask, which was grown for 1 day at 20°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The strain was grown in a base medium composed of 100 g/L malt extract (ME) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with YPD. The resulting culture was used to inoculate a 1 L preculture in a 2L glass Erlenmeyer flask, which was then grown for 2 days at 20°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The resulting culture was then used to inoculate four 2 L cultures in 4 L glass Erlenmeyer flasks, which were then grown for 1 day at 20°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The resulting cultures were then used to inoculate 8 L cultures in 3-gallon glass carboys (Midwest Supplies, Roseville, MN). These cultures were equipped with a one-way airlock for microaerobic fermentation and grown for 6 days at 20°C. In the meantime, 5 different Cascade hop samples grown on farms across the Pacific Northwest were obtained from YCH Hops (Yakima, WA). The hop samples were ground using a mortar and pestle and liquid nitrogen. On day 6, samples were taken from the fermentations (as un-hopped controls) and 25 grams of hops was added to each fermentation. Hops were left to steep for 3 days afterwhich samples were collected for GC/MS analysis.Batch-to-batch variation.Strains were streaked on YPD medium and grown for 2 days at 25°C. Single colonies were used to inoculate initial 5 mL precultures in glass test tubes, which were grown for 2 daysat 20°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Strains were grown in a base medium composed of 100 g/L malt extract (ME) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The resulting cultures were used to inoculate 500 mL precultures in 2L glass Erlenmeyer flasks, which were then grown for 1 day at 20°C with shaking at 200 rpm. The resulting cultures were then used to inoculate 8 L cultures in 3-gallon glass carboys (Midwest Supplies, Roseville, MN). These cultures were equipped with a one-way airlock for microaerobic fermentation and grown for 12 days at 20°C. Samples were taken on day 12 for GC/MS analysis.Data availability.

            "abstract": "Extensive literature on study abroad outcomes documents the benefits of study abroad for all undergraduate students, regardless of academic major.  However, engineering majors, at 5% of all undergraduate students nationally who study abroad, are substantially less likely to study abroad than their social science peers, at 17.3% participation (IIE, 2016).  Yet engineering majors have much to gain from international experiences: engineering is a global profession, and these future engineers will be expected not only to work in diverse teams but also travel and work abroad.  The purpose of this study is: (a)to explore the goals, motivations and challenges or barriers that undergraduate engineering majors face in their decision-making regarding study abroad, particularly in comparison to those motivations and barriers identified in the literature;(b) to identify outcomes of study abroad for this group of students and how they believe study abroad might impact their future; and (c) to explore students’ decision-making regardingengineering study abroad from academic advisors’ perspectives.These advisors not only support undergraduates’ academic needs on campus but also help them plan for study abroad. The theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Azjen, 1975) andtransformational learning theory (Mezirow, 1991) formed the theoretical framework for this study.  Combined, these theories form the basis of a conceptual model to explain the decision-making process of studying abroad and how study abroad can be a transformative learning experience for study abroad participants.This study employed a mixed methods methodology (Creswell, 2014) to address the research questions.  First, a survey was sent to engineering undergraduates who had participated in study abroad at 8 different undergraduate institutionswithin a university system.  Then, based on survey responses, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 of the survey participants.  Concurrently, 7 academic advisors were interviewed in order to shed light on the advising process for engineering majors to study abroad.   Personal and institutional factors were found to be the primary considerations in deciding whether to study abroad.Personal factors included students’ desires forcultural experiences and their internal driveto overcome any obstacles they faced.  Institutionally, curriculum restrictions for engineering majors and student fearsabout delay in graduationchallenged study abroad participation.  Outcomes included students’ alteration of career plans, increasing their insight into other cultures, and increasing their comfort with working abroad.",

            "title": "Advanced ignition for automotive engines",
            "tl;dr": "",         
            "abstract": "Spark plugs have been igniting combustible mixtures like those found in automotive enginesfor  over  a  century,  and  the  principles  of  the  associated  ignition  techniques  usingthermalplasma (inductive or capacitive sparks) have remained relatively unchanged during that time.However, internal combustion engines are increasingly operating with boosted intake pres-sures (i.e.  turbo- or super-charged) in order to maintain power output while simultaneouslyreducing engine size and weight, and they are also operating with increased recirculated ex-haust gas dilution to reduce the production of harmful nitrogen oxides.  This “downsizing” toincrease fuel economy compounded with diluting to decrease emissions leads to challenges inboth obtaining traditional ignition and promoting sufficiently fast combustion under this op-erating paradigm.  In conjunction with appropriate electrode design, transientnon-thermalplasma  can  exploit  certain  non-equilibrium  chemistry  and  physics  to  bypass  these  chal-lenges and ultimately promote more reliable ignition and faster combustion.  Applied andfundamental experimental investigations of two different advanced ignition techniques arepresented:  1) corona discharges igniting gasoline/air/exhaust mixtures in a boosted direct-injection  single  cylinder  research  engine  and  2)  repetitively  pulsed  nanosecond  dischargesigniting  methane/air  mixtures  in  a  constant  volume  chamber.   The  engine  experimentalresults show significant decreases in fuel consumption and nitrogen oxide emissions underboosted operation, and both experiments demonstrate more robust ignition and faster flamedevelopment.  The constant volume chamber results in particular raise important questionsabout the relative contributions of chemistry and transport to the experimentally observedcombustion enhancement.  These results highlight the critical importance of electrode designin advanced ignition techniques—the shape and position of electrodes greatly influences thehydrodynamics of developing flame kernels into fuel-air charges.  While this work demon-strates that non-thermal plasma ignition is a promising solution to both increase fuel econ-omy and decrease emissions of future automotive engines, much work remains to be done tounderstand the beneficial coupling between the detailed non-thermal plasma chemistry andthe hydrodynamics associated with these real ignition devices.",

            "output": "To  analyze  the  flame  development  associated  with  PND  ignition,  a  1.45  L  stainless  steelconstant volume combustion chamber with optical window access for high-speed schlierenimaging  was  used.   Diagrams  of  the  chamber  and  the  schlieren  optical  setup  are  shownin  Figure  4.1.   In  this  work,  ignition  was  provided  by  both  a  traditional  inductive  spark(SI) and a nanosecond pulse generator (Transient Plasma Systems, Inc.)  that uses a rapid voltage  rise  (∼10  kV)  and  short  voltage  pulse  (12  ns)  to  induce  streamer  discharges  at10 kHz between the non-resistive electrodes in the chamber. A conceptual diagram comparingthe voltage of a conventional inductive spark system and that of 10 pulses from the PNDignition system is shown in Figure 4.2.  The electrodes used were of custom experimentalgeometry,  shown  in  Figure  4.3.   The  geometry  of  the  electrode  in  the  left  of  Figure  4.3with a 2.5 mm electrode gap was chosen for our tests because it is the same geometry usedin the aforementioned E85 (Sj ̈oberg et al., 2014) and gasoline (Sevik et al., 2016) internalcombustion engine experiments.  The effect of number of pulsesnpwas investigated, varyingfrom 2, 5, 10, to 20 pulses.  Separate tests were conducted with the geometry shown in theright  of  Figure  4.3  with  a  3.25  mm  gap  to  qualitatively  examine  attempts  at  multi-pointignition.For each experiment, the chamber was evacuated and then filled with methane and airmixed at an equivalence ratio (φ) of 0.7±0.03 to an initial pressurePinitof 200±0.5 kPa.φwas measured using species partial pressures in a separate premixed tank to ensure con-sistent fuel concentration and mixing.  This value ofφwas chosen because reliable ignition could be obtained using both ignition techniques in this fuel-air mixture, facilitating theircomparison.  The initial temperature in the chamber was measured as 300±5 K with a K-type thermocouple.  This corresponds to a number density of approximatelyn= 80 mol/m3,which falls just inside the range of number densities in some of the preheated E85 engineexperiments by Sj ̈oberg et al. (2014).  Non-thermal plasma chemistry is a strong functionof  the  reduced  electric  field,E/n(Fridman,  2008a),  and  so  the  behavior  of  the  dischargeat engine-relevant densities is expected to be similar to the behavior during engine opera-tion, even though the subsequent flame kernel development will be different.  The pressureinside the chamber during ignition and flame development was measured at 100 kHz usinga piezoelectric pressure transducer (6052B Kistler) and the signals were amplified using adual-mode  charge  amplifier  (5010B  Kistler).   Schlieren  imaging  was  performed  at  50  kHzusing high-speed camera (Photron FASTCAM SA4), recording the development of the flamekernel during the first few milliseconds after ignition through the quartz windows.  The sizeof  the  premixed  tank  restricted  the  total  number  of  experiments;  at  least  nine  runs  percondition were possible.For the PND experiments, the voltage and current across the electrodes during the firstpulse  were  measured  with  an  inline  high-voltage  attenuator  and  current  probe  (TransientPlasma Systems, Inc.)  and recorded with a digital oscilloscope at 2.5 GHz (Tektronix TDS3024B). The first pulse in every experiment was highly consistent, though recent pressure-rise calorimetry work by Wolk and Ekoto (2017) has shown that subsequent pulses are notnecessarily the same as the first, which will be discussed later.Experimental data analysisThe net heat release rates (HRR) of the ignition experiments are calculated based on thein-chamber pressure history using Equation 4.1, whereVis the chamber volume andγis theratio of specific heats (Heywood, 1988). This is the same as Equation 3.1 in Chapter 3, exceptVis constant, and so alldVterms are zero.  Heat losses through the chamber walls are notconsidered and so these calculations are for comparison only.γis determined by weightingthe average of the specific heats in the burned (γb) and unburned (γu) states according toEquation  4.2,  in  whichβis  a  progress  variable  defined  by  Equation  4.3.γbandγuarecalculated from 1-D adiabatic free flame simulations inCantera(Goodwin et al., 2014)using  mixture-averaged  transport  properties  and  the  GRI-MECH  3.0  mechanism  (Smithet al., 1999).Equation 4.1 is integrated over time in Equation 4.4 to obtain the cumulative net heat releaseas a function of time,Qnet(t), as well as the total net heat released,Qnet,tot.Qnet,totis usedto  calculate  theflame  development  time,τd,  andflame  rise  time,τr.   In  this  study,τdisdefined as the time between ignition and when the first 10% ofQnet,tothas been achieved.Similarly,τris defined as the time between when the first 10% and the first 90% ofQnet,tothasbeen achieved.  These measurements are conceptually similar to those of CA10 and CA90 inChapter 3, and a conceptual diagram of these timescales with respect toQnet(t) is shown inFigure 4.4.  They are typically comparable with one another (Heywood, 1988) and allow usto compare the influence of the PND system at both early and late stages of the combustionprocess.  The sum ofτdandτris referred to as theoverall burning time,τo, and this is usedto compare overall combustion time.For  each  experiment,  the  flame  sizeLfis  calculated  based  on  the  high-speed  imagingdata using an edge-detection algorithm inMatlabto track the greatest extent of the flamekernel after subtracting the first frame from every frame of the footage.  This measurementis then numerically differentiated with respect to time to calculate burned flame speedsb.Unburned flame speedsuis calculated by multiplyingsbby the adiabatic density ratio ofthe burned and unburned mixture,ρb/ρu, as in Equation 4.5. Like the values ofγbandγu,ρb/ρuis obtained from the aforementionedCantera(Goodwinet al., 2014) simulations.  The simulation is also used to calculate a reference unburned flamespeed,su,ref, with which to compare the experimental unburned flame speeds obtained fromEquation 4.5.  This method of calculatingsuis acceptable because the thermal and massdiffusivities  of  methane/air  flames  are  approximately  equal,  and  so  flame  stretch  effects are negligible for most of the flame kernel evolution (Law, 2006).  This calculation is usedprimarily as a method of comparison among the different ignition conditions, and secondarilyto confirm that the measuredφ,Pinit, andTuare reasonably accurate.  If they are accurate,then the calculatedsuof the flames will approachsu,refas the flame leaves the region ofthe electrodes.  The experimental uncertainties ∆φ= 0.03, ∆Pinit= 0.5 kPa, and ∆Tu=5 K are propagated to calculate deviations insu,ref,  and these uncertainties are added inquadrature (Coleman and Steele, 2009) as in Equation 4.6.The reference unburned flame speed is calculated assu,ref= 13.9±2.0 cm/s.For tests with the disk electrode,  the total schlieren image intensity is calculated as afunction of time.  The first frame is subtracted from every frame of footage, and so only thetotal intensity of the resulting differences is calculated.  The intensity serves as a measure of“schlieren activity,” indicating thermal events associated with the pulsed discharges, and isparticularly useful for detecting events otherwise unobservable to the human eye."

            "title": "Advanced ignition for automotive engines",
            "tl;dr": "",         
            "abstract": "Spark plugs have been igniting combustible mixtures like those found in automotive enginesfor  over  a  century,  and  the  principles  of  the  associated  ignition  techniques  usingthermalplasma (inductive or capacitive sparks) have remained relatively unchanged during that time.However, internal combustion engines are increasingly operating with boosted intake pres-sures (i.e.  turbo- or super-charged) in order to maintain power output while simultaneouslyreducing engine size and weight, and they are also operating with increased recirculated ex-haust gas dilution to reduce the production of harmful nitrogen oxides.  This “downsizing” toincrease fuel economy compounded with diluting to decrease emissions leads to challenges inboth obtaining traditional ignition and promoting sufficiently fast combustion under this op-erating paradigm.  In conjunction with appropriate electrode design, transientnon-thermalplasma  can  exploit  certain  non-equilibrium  chemistry  and  physics  to  bypass  these  chal-lenges and ultimately promote more reliable ignition and faster combustion.  Applied andfundamental experimental investigations of two different advanced ignition techniques arepresented:  1) corona discharges igniting gasoline/air/exhaust mixtures in a boosted direct-injection  single  cylinder  research  engine  and  2)  repetitively  pulsed  nanosecond  dischargesigniting  methane/air  mixtures  in  a  constant  volume  chamber.   The  engine  experimentalresults show significant decreases in fuel consumption and nitrogen oxide emissions underboosted operation, and both experiments demonstrate more robust ignition and faster flamedevelopment.  The constant volume chamber results in particular raise important questionsabout the relative contributions of chemistry and transport to the experimentally observedcombustion enhancement.  These results highlight the critical importance of electrode designin advanced ignition techniques—the shape and position of electrodes greatly influences thehydrodynamics of developing flame kernels into fuel-air charges.  While this work demon-strates that non-thermal plasma ignition is a promising solution to both increase fuel econ-omy and decrease emissions of future automotive engines, much work remains to be done tounderstand the beneficial coupling between the detailed non-thermal plasma chemistry andthe hydrodynamics associated with these real ignition devices.",

            "output": "While increasing the number of pulses generally reduces flame development time, the reduction-per-pulse relative to SI ignition reduces with each additional pulse, indicating that the bene-fits associated with additional pulses decreases as the flame kernel develops.  As the numberof pulses increases, the peak pressure increases and the peak pressure occurs earlier.  Thishelps explains some of the efficiency gains observed in previous engine experiments (Sj ̈oberget al., 2014; Sevik et al., 2016).Hydrodynamic effectsThe high-speed images in Figure 4.7 show that there is a significant non-chemical componentto the combustion enhancement.  The flame kernel is driven away from the electrodes, re-ducing heat losses to the electrodes from the developing flame.  While this helps explain thereducedτdin the pulsed cases, increased flame kernel expulsion alone does not completelyexplain the decreases inτdbetween the inductive spark cases and the pulsed discharge cases(a decrease of 10±1.8 ms), since the flame kernel from the inductive spark discharge is ini-tially the same size or larger than the flame kernels from the 2-pulse and 5-pulse discharges,as shown in Figure 4.8.  The high-speed images in Figure 4.7 show increased flame wrinkling,a phenomenon which increases the surface area of the flame in contact with the unburnedmixture  and  enhances  the  overall  burning  rate.   This  enhancement  effect  persists  beyondthe initial flame development, which is whyτralso slightly decreases in the pulsed dischargecases.The causes for the instabilities which increase flame wrinkling are likely rooted in localpressure changes caused by the repetitive discharges.  TheLfdata in the inset of Figure 4.8show that the continued discharges are the primary factor in the divergence of the differentPND ignition modes—for the first 10 pulses of the 20-pulse case, the averageLfis similar tothat of the 10-pulse case, and so on.  Reactive flow experiments by Lefkowitz and Ombrello(2017b)  have  shown  evidence  of  pulse-to-pulse  coupling,  in  which  a  moving  flame  kernelignited by a nanosecond pulsed discharge is influenced by subsequent pulses.  Although thegases  in  this  experiment  are  initially  quiescent,  the  pulses  could  induce  some  bulk  fluidmotion.  3-D Direct Numerical Simulation modeling by Castela et al. (2016) and associatedexperimental work by Lovascio et al. (2017) with pin-to-pin electrode geometries have shownas  such.   The  aforementioned  pressure-rise  calorimetry  experiments  by  Wolk  and  Ekoto (2017) indicate that transient arc breakdown is more likely as the number of pulses increase,and that these discharges cause more rapid local gas heating than low temperature plasma(LTP) discharges.  As additional pulses are driven between the electrodes, the lower numberdensity increases the local reduced electric field, so that the successive pulses are “thermallypreconditioned”  into  transitioning  to  arc.   In  our  study,  the  pressure  gradients  associatedwith this phenomenon interact with the electrode shape to drive the hot gases away fromthe cold metal surfaces, simultaneously reducing heat losses and increasing wrinkling of theflame kernel surface.Chemical effectsThe  effect  of  chemistry  on  combustion  enhancement  is  more  difficult  to  discern  from  thepresented measurements, and thus only limited conclusions can be drawn from the results.The high-speed schlieren images of the disk electrode in Figure 4.9 definitely show a decreasein local fluid density—indicating a rise in local fluid temperature, a reduction in number ofmolecules, or both.  Visible-light photographs of the streamers for this electrode are shownin  Figure  4.10.   A  comparison  between  Figure  4.9  and  Figure  4.10  is  highly  suggestive  ofa  link  between  the  observed  density  gradients  and  the  streamers.   A  plot  of  the  schlierenactivity for the experiment shown in Figure 4.9 is shown in Figure 4.11.  It can be seen thateach  PND  event  is  associated  with  a  rise  in  schlieren  activity,  indicating  changes  in  localdensity gradients in the image.  Though the reasons for this cannot be confirmed withouthigh-resolution species measurements in time, a survey of the plasma literature suggests thatthe likely culprit for these gradients is an increase in the local gas temperature caused by fast gas heating processes associated with LTP discharges.  These processes include electron-ionrecombination, quenching of electronically-excited N2and O (Stancu et al., 2010; Bak et al.,2011;  Lo  et  al.,  2014a),  radical  recombination  (Pendleton  et  al.,  2013),  and  relaxation  ofvibrationally excited O2and N2(Ono et al., 2010; Lo et al., 2014b).  In air at atmosphericpressure, these processes occur on timescales spanning∼10 ns to∼100μs, and so differentprocesses may influence the results seen in Figure 4.11 at different times.More conclusively, the fact that ignition was not possible using a single pulsed discharge inany of the experiments suggests that although reactive species are generated, not enough areproduced, and/or the local gas temperature is not high enough (>∼700 K) to sustain chain-branching reactions (Law, 2006).  The decrease in schlieren activity following each pulse inFigure 4.11 is likely due to the diffusion of the density gradient into the surrounding mixture,but subsequent pulses drive the temperature and/or radical increases required for successfulignition.   The  gas  is  ‘primed’  for  the  next  pulse:  since  the  number  density  is  lower,  thereduced electric field of the next pulse is higher, approaching the threshold to arc transition,as was observed in the engine experiments using the same electrode geometry (Sj ̈oberg et al.,2014)."

            "abstract": "Flowers of the hop plant provide both bitterness and “hoppy” flavor to beer. Hops are, however, both a water and energy intensive crop and vary considerably in essential oil content, making it challenging to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer.Here wereport that brewer’s yeast can be engineered to biosynthesize aromatic monoterpene molecules that impart hoppy flavor to beer by incorporating recombinant DNA derived from yeast, mint, and basil. Whereas metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways is commonly enlisted to maximize product titers, tuning expression of pathway enzymes to affect target production levels of multiple commercially important metabolites without major collateral metabolic changes represents a unique challenge. By applying state-of-the-art engineering techniques and a framework to guide iterative improvement, strains are generated with target performance characteristics. Beers produced using these strains are perceived as hoppier than traditionally hopped beers by a sensory panel in a double-blind tasting.",

            "output": "In this study, we have engineered brewer’s yeast for production of flavor molecules ordinarily derived from hops. We developed new methods to overcome the difficulties associated with stable integration of large constructs in industrial strains. Unlike classical microbial metabolic engineering efforts that focus on maximizing the titer of a single molecule, we focused on tuning the expression of key genes in a biosynthetic pathway to make precise concentrations of the desired flavors. This application promises to generate hop flavors with more consistency than traditional hop additions, as hop preparations are notoriously variable in the content of their essential oil and the flavor they impart to beer71. It should be noted that blending hop preparations from different sources can be used to reduce variation. However, blending is ultimately limited by practical constraints: In the best case, large craft breweries create one single hop blend per year, which fails to mitigate year-to-year variation. Our strategy is favored over plant or microbial bioprocess extraction because it avoids the use of non-renewable chemicals typical of industrial extraction. While historic consumer trepidation towards genetically engineered foods is of concern for widespread adoption, the general increase in consumer acceptance of such foods when tied to increased sustainability84is encouraging.Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of engineering brewer’s yeast by incorporation of heterologous genes85,86,87; however, the scope and commercial relevance of these efforts have been limited, in part due to methodological difficulties of incorporating an array of large, genetically stable DNA constructs into industrial yeasts. Recent studies have resorted to alternative methods such as breeding hybrid strains88. While this has proven to be a powerful approach for generating diverse aroma phenotypes, it is intrinsically limited to enzymes and aromas associated with native yeast metabolism. Here, we developed a complementary methodology that allows for stable incorporation of plant secondary metabolism genes into industrial brewer’s yeast. We provide evidence that incorporating linalool and geraniol biosynthesis confers hop flavor to beer. We note that the full flavor imparted by traditional hopping is likely to rely on a more diverse bouquet of molecules. The methodologies described herein provide a foundation for generating more complex yeast-derived hop flavors, and broaden the possibilities of yeast-biosynthesized flavor molecules to those throughout the plant kingdom."

            "output": "The purpose of this study was to explore and analyze study abroad for engineering majors from both the students’ perspectives and academic advisors’ perspectives. Specifically, this study analyzed goals and motivations, facilitators and challenges, reflection, and outcomes of the study abroad experience.  Engineering students are under-represented in study abroad, yet the engineering profession is global and engineerswill need to adapt to the global workplace.  The current study used both Fishbien and Ajzen’s (1975) theory of reasoned action and Mezirow’s (1991) transformational learning theory as a guiding theoretical framework, andcombined Kasravi’s (2009) and Johnson’s (2016) models to form the conceptual framework.  To achieve the purpose of the study,fourresearch questionswere presented: 1.What are undergraduate engineering majors’ goals and motivations for studying abroad?2.What barriers and challenges do undergraduate engineering majors face in their attempts to study abroad?3.What outcomes do undergraduate engineering majors report as a result of studying abroad?4.What are academic advisors’ perspectives of undergraduate engineering majors’ goals and motivations for studying abroad, as well astheir perspectives ofbarriers and challenges that these students face? This chapter presents a summary and discussion of the major findings, as well as implications for theory and practice.General Outcomes This study also sought to explore and analyze the impact of study abroad for engineering majors.  Through both the survey and theindividual interviews, it is clear that studying abroad does have a strong impact.  On the survey, the two categories that were ranked closest to “strongly agree” were Impact on International/Intercultural Understanding and Competence and Impact on Personal Development.  Students strongly agreed that study abroad increased their insight and appreciation of other cultures.  Additionally, study abroad made them more self-reliant, independent, and increasedtheir self-confidence.  Bettez and Lineberry (2004) also found that students ranked personal outcomes over academic outcomes.  Engineering learning, in both the survey and the interview, was of secondary importance to students.  Other studies have also found that academic learning is secondary to the personal learning students experience while abroad (Bettez & Lineberry, 2004; Carlson et al., 1990; Chambers & Chambers, 2008).  One possible reason for this is that students in engineering majors, like students in other majors, go abroad for their own personal interest.  Perhaps they have a hierarchical view of American science education (Klahr & Ratti, 2000) so they would rather complete courses for their major at home.  In the current study, a few students did report that the education abroad was less rigorous than the education at home.  Some studies have measured engineering learning in engineering-specific study abroad programs (DiBiasio & Mello, 2004; Maldonado et al., 2014; Schubert & Jacobitz, 2013).  These studies tend to have more successful results in engineering learning, as they are focused on engineering.  The results from this study show that without purposeful planning in engineering, engineering learning is of secondary importance.  While many students appreciated the hands on nature of engineering learning while abroad, they did not find their technical skills to be much improved over courses taken at the home university.  Study abroad impacted students’ careers in three ways: by altering or confirming their career paths, by appealing to employers, and by interest in working internationally.  On the survey, students reported that they would feel comfortable working internationally and that study abroad was important to their professional development.  However in the interviews the outcomes were a little more nuanced.  While some students felt that study abroad made them a more attractive candidate to employers, others were unsure.  Additionally, three of 11students felt that after getting exposure to international living, they would not like to work internationally.  Outcomes by Program DurationMany studies have sought to measure outcomes based on program duration.  In this study, outcomes appeared to be nearly the same regardless of program duration.  The top two outcomes were the same: study abroad was important to students’ personal development and gave them increased insight into other cultures.  In a longitudinal study, Dwyer (2002) found that yearlongstudents were more likely to use a foreign language on a regular basis and were more likely to report that study abroad increased their self-confidence.  While these factors did not emerge as differences in this study, it is perhaps to soon to tell—in a retrospective study, these differences might emerge as more profound.  Ingraham and Peterson (2003) found differences in the impact of students’ career development as a result of studying abroad, indicating that the longer students went abroad, the more impactful the experience was for career development.  At this point, career development did not emerge as a significant difference in this study.Outcomes by GenderIn general, most outcomes did not vary significantly by gender.  This finding counters other studies (Vande Berg et al., 2009) which did find significant differences between males and females.  Unlike in other studies, for the few findings that did show significant differences, males actually reported stronger impacts than females.  In this study, males were more likely to report an increase in second-language competency than females.  In the Georgetown Consortium study (Vande Berg et al., 2009), females made significantly greater progress in foreign language acquisition than males.  While the results of this study were based on self-reports and not on a foreign language exam, it is promising to see that males did report an increase in second-language competency.  It is possible that the males in this study were highly motivated to learn a foreign language.  Indeed, both Jeffrey and Jim purposefully chose programs where the language of instruction was not English. Additionally in the Georgetown Consortium study, females made statistically significant gains in intercultural learning, while males did not.  In the currentstudy, males were more likely to have increased contact with international students on campus than females.  These findings seem to indicate that when males are highly motivated to study abroad and increase their intercultural competency and understanding, they do so at rates equal to, or higher than,females.  ReflectionInterview participants described reflecting in two ways: alone and with others.  Some students reflected in multiple ways, but in general reflection did not emerge as important for students to help them process what they learned abroad.  Some students found it either challenging or not important to reflect while abroad.While students in this study found it difficult to dedicate time to reflection, they are not unusual.  Many studies have found that often students will not reflect on their experiences without reflection timeincorporated into the education abroad curriculum.  In order for more transformational learningto occur, several studies show the importance of guided reflection (Paige & Goode, 2009; Root & Ngampornchai, 2012;Vande Berg et al., 2009; Wessels et al., 2011).  Students are less likely to reflect if they are not guided throughout their program.  If reflection truly is a key component to perspective change, then adding required guided reflection throughout programsis critical.  Additionally, students need to be guided on how to reflect.  Root and Ngampornchai (2012) suggest counseling students on the importance of reflection in pre-departure programs.  Implications of the Findings for Global EngineersOne of the purposes of this study was to determine if study abroad is an effective way to develop “global engineers.”The literature has reportedthat engineers need to become global engineers in order to be successful in their careers.In this study, the term global engineerwas explored through the development of global competency (Parkinson, 2009) and professional, or soft,skills (ABET Criterion 3 guidelines; Shuman et al., 2005).  Global CompetencyGlobal engineers must be globally competent.  This study utilized the conceptualization of global competencyfromParkinson (2009). Globally competent engineers possess the following characteristics: 1.can appreciate other cultures.2.are proficient working in or directing a team of ethnic and cultural diversity. 3.are able to communicate across cultures.4.have had a chance to practice engineering in a global context, whether through an international internship, a service-learning opportunity, a virtual global engineering project or some other form of experience.5.caneffectively deal with ethical issues arising from cultural or national differences. (p. 12-13) The students in this study reported outcomes similar to the attributes of global competency.  Because of studying abroad, they developed a strong appreciationfor other cultures and a new perspective of the world(attribute #1).  Many students had the opportunitiesto work in multi-ethnic teams, and all students learned the difficulties of communicating across cultures, especially when the dominant language is not Englishfor everyone involved(attributes #2 and #3).  While most students did take courses in engineering, not all students had the opportunity to practice hands-on engineering projects(attribute #4).  These skills would be better measured inengineering-specificlearning programs.  And while it is too soon to learn if students can effectively deal with cultural and national differences in their careers(attribute #5), the experiences of studying abroad did provide a strong foundation for enhanced global-mindedness.  Soft SkillsIt has been speculated that many of the soft skills recognized by the ABET Criterion 3 guidelines can be improved through study abroad.  Attempting to measure the growth of each of the soft skills was outside the scope of this study, but the findings did point to development offour skills: the ability to function on multidisciplinary teams;the ability to communicate effectively;the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context;andknowledge of contemporary issues.The students in this study reported that study abroad improved their ability to work as team members, particularly with students from other cultures.  Peter led a team ofother engineers in creating a Formula One racing car.  In this team, he had to navigate working with students from other cultures.  Michael explained that he was reluctant to work with a group of local Singapore students because he was unsure of their capabilitiesin computer science, but after working with them felt that they were just as competent, if not moreso, aspeers at his home university.  Additionally, it was apparent that they did come away from their experience with a broadened understanding of engineering. Students found “there’s more than one way to solve a problem.”  By taking courses abroad, they understood the engineering issues that people in other countries face.  Many students also described abilities to compare political and social issues with those of the United States.  Simply living abroad for a semester or more gave them the ability to identify important issues in their host countries.  Implications of the Findings for TheoryTheory of Reasoned ActionFishbien and Ajzen’s (1975) theory of reasoned action helps explain a person’s intent to perform a behavior; in this context, that behavior was the decision to study abroad.  The theory posits that two factors directly relate to a person’s intent to perform a behavior: his or her attitude toward the behavior and the subjective norm regarding the behavior.  The subjective norm consists of other peoples’ beliefs about performing the behavior, which may influence a person’s motivation to perform that behavior.Kasravi (2009), building on the theory based on research from Booker (2001) and Peterson (2003), re-conceptualized the theory of reasoned action as personal and social factors that help explain why students may or may not participate in study abroad.  Based on findings, she added a third determinant: institutional factors, like program cost and availability of classes, that also influence intent to study abroad.  Interview participants in this study confirmed that personal, social, and institutional factors facilitated or challenged study abroad participation.  Importantly, interview participants explained the challenges of using courses takenabroad to satisfymajor requirements.  These institutional challenges could only be overcome through their strong internal drive to study abroad, which for some students meant extending their time to degree.  Considering that students’ strong desires to study abroad helped them to overcome these challenges recognizes that both personal and institutional factors can facilitate study abroad. Transformational Learning Theory The experiences abroad, which encompasses interacting with individuals from other cultures, becomes a catalyst for deep change. Transformational learning theory(Mezirow, 1991) is a theoretical description of the steps that learners go through to change their worldviews (Brock, 2009).  As Brock explains, “transformative learning is when a learner is struck by a new concept or way of thinking and then follows through to make a life change” (p. 2). Transformational learning theory provides a theoretical underpinning forthe possibilityof becominga global engineer and transforming in other ways as a result ofstudy abroad.  A disorienting dilemma serves as a catalyst for transformation.  In this study, as in other studies focusing on study abroad, the study abroad experience served as the disorienting dilemma.Much research indicates the importance of reflection in leading to perspective change.  In this study, reflection was not of central importance to interview participants.  However, one student, Peter, indicated a type of reflection that is less common in the literature: taking pictures and reviewing what he saw at the end of the day.  Due to the prevalence of cameras, students can easily take pictures of what they saw or thought of.  This type of reflection not only engages students who might consider journal writing not useful, it also helps students process their experiences in a new way.  Additionally, reflection after the experience abroad is necessary as well.  It may be that the experience is too chaotic or fast-paced to stop and think about what they are learning.  But when students return home andcontinue to reflect, that is when the transformative learning actually occurs.  Measuring transformation may also not be possible in a short timeframe.  Some research does question whether transformation is “cataclysmic” or “gradual” (Brock, 2009).  In this study it appearsthat the process of transformation extends beyond students’ return home, perhaps even several months or years after their experience.  Measuring transformative learning too soon may cause students to feel they were not actually “transformed.”Integrated Conceptual Model In light of the findings from this study, the integrated conceptual model used for this study needs to be revised(see Figure 6.1).  Kasravi’s (2009) conceptual model (Figure 1.1) displays factors that positively influence study abroad.  Her findings revealed that personal factors weighed more heavily in decision-making than the social and institutional factors.While personal factors certainly outweighed others in terms of positively influencing study abroad, themodel must also incorporate barriers to studying abroad as well.  Institutional barriers (such as academics) weighed more heavily than personal and social barriers.  For that reason,the model in this study is revised to express the importance of both institutional factors and personal factors in engineering students’ decision-making regarding study abroad.Regarding transformational learning, Johnson's (2016) model (Figure 1.3) indicated that transformation ends before students return home.  However, this study concluded that transformation appears to continue when students return home, as they are making sense of their experience and understanding how their new perspectives will impact their daily lives.  For some students, this newfound perspective willcontinue as meaning schemes, whereas for others the newfound perspective will change their meaning perspective and become transformational learning.  Additionally, reflection appears to either start while students are abroad or once they return home.  Forthat reason, reflection was also added to the model to indicate that reflection is ongoing. Implications of the Findings for PracticeOne of the purposes of this study was to increase study abroad participation for engineering majors.  The findings of this study are valuable to both personnel in the college Home Background and Institution ContextDecision-Making Regarding Study Abroad Host Institution ContextWhile AbroadHome Institution Context and BeyondUpon ReturnOutcomes Personal  Factors Social  Factors Institutional Factors Attitude Toward Study Abroad  Decision to Study Abroad  Disorienting Dilemma Process of Transformation Return Home of engineering (faculty, administrators, and advisors) as well as study abroad offices.  These implications and recommendations come not only from the findings of this study but also from suggestions by students and advisors themselves.  Pre-Departure PhaseRecruiting engineering majors.In this study, few participants reported making the decision to study abroad because of the opportunity to develop as engineers.  However, the “soft skills”students developed abroad may be just as important as any technical skills that can be offered.  Particularlyin programs that are not geared toward engineering majors, the learning of soft skillscan be emphasized.  Recruitment material may need toinclude how study abroad helpsstudents develop valuable career-related skills, in addition to technical skills.  Academic advisors play an important role in promoting study abroad.  They encourage study abroad in the following ways: by speaking positively about the study abroad experience in general, by showing students how it is possible to fit study abroad into their 4-year plan, and by connecting prospective students with returned engineering students.  Advisors must also have accurate, updated information for students.  Misinformation can inhibit participation.  Advisors are particularly effective when they are familiar with program options that help students make progress toward their degrees.  Peer advisors can be just as effective if they are well-informed. Goldstein and Kim (2006) suggested encouraging participation by moving beyond academic integrationand careerdevelopment.  Instead, institutions are encouraged to develop programs on campus that give students accurate expectations regarding study abroad, increase their intercultural understanding and competence, and facilitate language learning.  With these objectives in mind, engineering students in particular may be more likely to want to studyabroad.  Faculty support, through both encouraging study abroad in their classrooms and by approving coursework taken abroad,is particularly crucial during this stage.  Research has shown that students are more likely to go abroad with strong support from faculty (Klahr &Ratti, 2000; Grandin & Hirleman, 2009; O’Hara, 2009; Paus & Robinson, 2008; Relyea et al., 2008; Spiering & Erickson, 2006).  Educating faculty on the importance of studying abroad for both academics and the development of important intercultural skills is key.  Any mechanisms or initiatives to encourage faculty to expedite decisions on course transferabilitywould enhance student participation.  Oftentimes students were deterred from studying abroad because faculty could not determine pre-departureif courses would meet major requirements.   Incorporating study abroad into engineering curriculum.One major barrier to engineering majors studying abroad is the rigidity of the engineering curriculum.  The strict guidelines set by ABET have been blamed for reducing the flexibility of the curriculum (Klahr & Ratti, 2000).  Even if curriculum requirements cannot change, it is possible to integrate study abroad into the curriculum.  For example, allow students one specific quarter they can study abroad. In this study, amajor challenge for students was finding courses that would satisfydegree requirements.  Colleges of engineering and the SAPO must work together so that students can easily find courses to take abroad. Colleges can facilitate study abroad by not only pre-approving coursesfor credit (as many study abroad programs already do) but also approving these courses to fulfill general education and major requirements(which is far less common).  Study abroad offices can facilitate access by giving students an easy way to find classes that are appropriate to take abroad, particularly courses that are appropriate forengineering majors.  Theseoffices are encouraged to maintain a database of courses that have been approved for major or general education credit and make them easy to find.  For universities with multi-campus systems, courses that have been approved at one campus as a course equivalent should also be approved at other campuses.  For example, if a course on “Dynamics” taken at a university abroad was approved by one campus in the system, it should be acceptable at all campuses in the system.    Program Phase One of the goals of study abroad programming for engineering majors is to encourage the development of engineers who are prepared to work globally and interact successfully with people from diverse cultures. To encourage this type of transformational learning, guided reflection is necessary to help students understand what they are learning and how these new experiences and skills can help them in the future.  Guided reflection should be incorporated into the curriculum.  As Taylor (2008) explains, educators must “take time to know students as individuals, recognizing their preferences, and engaging a variety of approaches in fostering transformative learning (p. 12).   This means that students should not be limited to reflecting through journals.  Some students may prefer talking with others or even taking pictures or drawing as a means of reflection. Returnee PhaseResults from this study suggest that students are unclear how employers may value their study abroad experience.  Additionally, while students gained many career-related skills by studying abroad, they were not always able to see the connections to their future careers. Career counselors could help students transfer the attitudes, skills, and abilities they learned from studying abroad ontotheir resumes.   Peer role models have been found to be important influences of study abroad, both in this study and in the literature reviewed.  Advisors should ask study abroad returnees to give testimonials of their experience.  Students who have successfully studied abroad for an academic year should be particularly encouraged to report on their experiences in order to show students that yearlong programs are possible.  Limitations and Recommendations for Future ResearchWhile this study contributes to the limited research in study abroad programming for engineering majors, there are a few limitations that must be mentioned. First, this study focused on one university system.  Future studies may wish to broaden the sampleto different university types or different locations throughout the United States.  Second, acommon limitation with study abroad research is self-selection bias, where students who choose to participate in the study are more inclined to describe favorable experiences and outcomes.  However, including varying program durations (like summer, semester, and yearlong) allowed for more variation in the outcomes. While both males and females were asked to participate in interviews, there was a gender imbalanceinthe interviews.  All academic advisors were female, and all students were male.While this does limit the generalizability of the findings,it was also important to hear the male voice, as male participation in study abroad is generally much lower than that for females (IIE, 2015c).  Future studies may wish to expand the definition of a “global engineer” and explore the development of global engineers during university study.  Researchers might ask experts in the field to define a global engineer.  Anadditional study could also look at what it means to be a global engineer in a different context, such as in a work setting.  Outside of the limitations, there are also several additional areas that are important to continue with future research.  Researchers might use the same survey or interview protocols with students from other majors.  Additionally, because longitudinal studies are lacking in the study abroad literature, it would be useful to follow up with students in 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years. It would be useful to compare engineers who had an international experience while in collegewith thosewho did notto measure global competency and the development of soft skills.Further, this study examined academic advisors’ perspectives on study abroad; faculty could comprise another study focus.  Engineering faculty have notably been less likely to encourage students to participate in international experiences (Grandin & Hirleman, 2009; O’Hara, 2009).  Future research could interview engineering faculty members to explore what is restricting them from encouraging study abroad."

            "abstract": "Spark plugs have been igniting combustible mixtures like those found in automotive enginesfor  over  a  century,  and  the  principles  of  the  associated  ignition  techniques  usingthermalplasma (inductive or capacitive sparks) have remained relatively unchanged during that time.However, internal combustion engines are increasingly operating with boosted intake pres-sures (i.e.  turbo- or super-charged) in order to maintain power output while simultaneouslyreducing engine size and weight, and they are also operating with increased recirculated ex-haust gas dilution to reduce the production of harmful nitrogen oxides.  This “downsizing” toincrease fuel economy compounded with diluting to decrease emissions leads to challenges inboth obtaining traditional ignition and promoting sufficiently fast combustion under this op-erating paradigm.  In conjunction with appropriate electrode design, transientnon-thermalplasma  can  exploit  certain  non-equilibrium  chemistry  and  physics  to  bypass  these  chal-lenges and ultimately promote more reliable ignition and faster combustion.  Applied andfundamental experimental investigations of two different advanced ignition techniques arepresented:  1) corona discharges igniting gasoline/air/exhaust mixtures in a boosted direct-injection  single  cylinder  research  engine  and  2)  repetitively  pulsed  nanosecond  dischargesigniting  methane/air  mixtures  in  a  constant  volume  chamber.   The  engine  experimentalresults show significant decreases in fuel consumption and nitrogen oxide emissions underboosted operation, and both experiments demonstrate more robust ignition and faster flamedevelopment.  The constant volume chamber results in particular raise important questionsabout the relative contributions of chemistry and transport to the experimentally observedcombustion enhancement.  These results highlight the critical importance of electrode designin advanced ignition techniques—the shape and position of electrodes greatly influences thehydrodynamics of developing flame kernels into fuel-air charges.  While this work demon-strates that non-thermal plasma ignition is a promising solution to both increase fuel econ-omy and decrease emissions of future automotive engines, much work remains to be done tounderstand the beneficial coupling between the detailed non-thermal plasma chemistry andthe hydrodynamics associated with these real ignition devices.",

Hops are, however, both a water and energy intensive crop and vary considerably in essential oil content, making it challenging to achieve a consistent hoppy taste in beer.Here wereport that brewer’s yeast can be engineered to biosynthesize aromatic monoterpene molecules that impart hoppy flavor to beer by incorporating recombinant DNA derived from yeast, mint, and basil. Whereas metabolic engineering of biosynthetic pathways is commonly enlisted to maximize product titers, tuning expression of pathway enzymes to affect target production levels of multiple commercially important metabolites without major collateral metabolic changes represents a unique challenge. By applying state-of-the-art engineering techniques and a framework to guide iterative improvement, strains are generated with target performance characteristics. Beers produced using these strains are perceived as hoppier than traditionally hopped beers by a sensory panel in a double-blind tasting.",

            "title": "Developing a Global Engineer: Study Abroad Experiences of Engineering Majors in One University System",
            "tl;dr": "",         
            "abstract": "Extensive literature on study abroad outcomes documents the benefits of study abroad for all undergraduate students, regardless of academic major.  However, engineering majors, at 5% of all undergraduate students nationally who study abroad, are substantially less likely to study abroad than their social science peers, at 17.3% participation (IIE, 2016).  Yet engineering majors have much to gain from international experiences: engineering is a global profession, and these future engineers will be expected not only to work in diverse teams but also travel and work abroad.  The purpose of this study is: (a)to explore the goals, motivations and challenges or barriers that undergraduate engineering majors face in their decision-making regarding study abroad, particularly in comparison to those motivations and barriers identified in the literature;(b) to identify outcomes of study abroad for this group of students and how they believe study abroad might impact their future; and (c) to explore students’ decision-making regardingengineering study abroad from academic advisors’ perspectives.These advisors not only support undergraduates’ academic needs on campus but also help them plan for study abroad. The theory of reasoned action (Fishbein & Azjen, 1975) andtransformational learning theory (Mezirow, 1991) formed the theoretical framework for this study.  Combined, these theories form the basis of a conceptual model to explain the decision-making process of studying abroad and how study abroad can be a transformative learning experience for study abroad participants.This study employed a mixed methods methodology (Creswell, 2014) to address the research questions.  First, a survey was sent to engineering undergraduates who had participated in study abroad at 8 different undergraduate institutionswithin a university system.  Then, based on survey responses, in-depth interviews were conducted with 11 of the survey participants.  Concurrently, 7 academic advisors were interviewed in order to shed light on the advising process for engineering majors to study abroad.   Personal and institutional factors were found to be the primary considerations in deciding whether to study abroad.Personal factors included students’ desires forcultural experiences and their internal driveto overcome any obstacles they faced.  Institutionally, curriculum restrictions for engineering majors and student fearsabout delay in graduationchallenged study abroad participation.  Outcomes included students’ alteration of career plans, increasing their insight into other cultures, and increasing their comfort with working abroad.",

            "output": "Globalization requires that engineering graduates become global engineers.  Global engineers are expected to embody the tenets of global competency and utilize the so-called soft skills in order to be successful in their careers.  This study attempted to determine if study abroad could develop global engineers.  While the definition of global engineering was limited, the students in this study showed promising characteristics consistent with global engineering.  Study abroad has proved to be an effective way at developing these important traits and skills. While the benefits of studying abroad for engineering majors are quite clear, the road to participation is difficult.  Both academic advisors and the students themselves identified barriers to participation, such as stringent academic requirements and the need for experiences like research and internships that employers seemingly value more.  Participation in study abroad is more likely when students themselves have an internal drive that motivates them to study abroad in spite of the barriers, and when academic advisors have carefully planned studying abroad into students’ degree plans.  In order for study abroad to be a truly beneficial international experience, students need support while abroadthat encourages them to become global engineers.  Particularly, guided reflection is an important way to help students make meaning of their experience.  With the support of a cultural mentoras emphasized in other literature (Anderson et al., 2006; Paige & Goode, 2009; Root & Ngampornchai, 2012; Vande Berg et al., 2009), students are likely to make connections between their experience abroad and the experiences employers are looking for.  Vande Berg and colleagues found that when students met with a cultural mentor “very often,” their intercultural learning scores dramatically increased.  Their time abroad serves more than just as a vacation or as a semester away; instead, it becomes a meaningful experience that helps them not only in their future careers but also in their personal lives."
