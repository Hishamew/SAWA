            "output": "The study of uranium heteroatom multiple bonds in recent years has yielded a wealth of information in how f-orbitals interact in bonding different atoms.1-6In addition, the study of uranyl and uranylanalogues has led to more information on the covalency of f-orbitals in the actinides. 1,7-11These studies have shown that f-orbitals in actinides do participate in the π-bonding in the metal ligandmultiple bonds.12Because of this information there has been a desire to synthesize new complexes containing new actinide ligand multiple bonds to study how the f-orbitals interact in bonds. Because the studyofuranyl has yielded a wealth of knowledge regarding the f-orbitals it has been proposed that studying systems that contain more than two uranium heteroatom multiple bonds would be fruitful as well. Recent work has succeeded in synthesizing complexes that contain three multiple bonds to heteroatoms.13The Bart group in collaboration with the Schelter group synthesized a uranium tris(imido complex). Upon reactinguranium tris-iodide with diisopropylphenyl (DIPP) azide in thepresence ofKC8,they synthesized the uranium tris(imido) complex(eq 2.1).14In this complex the imido ligands are coordinated in a facial orientation and not a uranyl like structure as would be desired. To remedy this a pyridine(diimine) (PDI) ligand was used to create a uranyl like environment about the uranium center.Having observed the synthesis of these complexes, we endeavored to synthesize new uranium complexes containing more than two multiple bonds. The target complex that was selected was the complex known as “reverse uranyl” that has only been observed in the solid state. 16Reverse uranyl describes a complex that contains four short multiple bonds in an equatorial plane and two long single bonds in an axial position. This would be the direct opposite of uranyl, which contains two short multiple bonds in the axial position and four long single bonds in the equatorial plane.17,18Reverse uranyl would be a dianionic compound which was previously thought to be too unstable,but calculationshave shown this to be a feasible, somewhat stable product.19This complex has been studied theoretically;it has been observed in the solid state however,a discrete independent molecule has not yet been synthesizedto confirm the theoretical structure. It has been recently hypothesized that the reverse uranyl may in fact distort into a tetrahedral environment instead of the previously hypothesized square planar geometry.20To explore the electronic structure and compare it to the proposed configuration we endeavored to synthesize this reverse uranyl.To synthesize reverse uranyl, we chose to utilize the method of reductive deprotection that has been used previously to synthesize several complexes containing metal heteroatom multiple bonds.21This method utilized the reductive bond cleavage of a bond between a protecting group and a heteroatom to form a metal heteroatom multiple bond. In the previous work by the Hayton group, the protecting group that was utilized was the triphenylmethyl group(eq 2.2.). Our objective is to first synthesize the uranyl alkoxide complex then reduce the complex and form reverse uranyl. Uranium alkoxide complexes have been studied for several decades and Gillman and coworkers first reported the preparation of uranium alkoxides and later Bradley and coworkers reported more uranium alkoxide complexes.16,22-27Uranyl alkoxide complexes can be made through either a salt metathesis or a ligand metathesis. The salt metathesis method utilizes a halide complex of uranyl and an alkali metal complex of the alkoxide ligand.28This method produces the corresponding salt and the desired alkoxide. However there is often the formation of a uranyl tris(alkoxide) ate complex. The second method utilizes a ligand metathesis. This method utilizes a metathesis with a uranyl amide complex and the desired alcohol. This reaction forms the desired alkoxide complex and an amine as the byproduct(eq 2.3).29This method is preferred due to the lack of possible byproducts from the reaction mixture.In this chapter the synthesis of the uranyl alkoxide, UO2(OCPh3)2THF2is discussed as well as the synthesis of the uranyl thiolate complex UO2(SCPh3)2THF2. The reactivity of these complexes toward several reducing agents is explored. The behavior of these complexes toward reducing agents is probed and the deviation from the expected reactivity is discussed."

            "abstract": "TOwing to superior mechanical properties such as high fatigue life and high yield strength of many non-equiatomichigh entropy alloys (HEA), a novel division of non-equiatomic FeNiCoAlTaB (NCATB) HEAs has been introduced. The novel NCTAB HEAs exhibit a very high yield stress which is around 1.1~1.2 GPa with appreciable ductility under quasi-static compression. The strengthening mechanisms in  NCATB-HEA  system  are  strongly  dependent  on  the  grain  precipitates,  solid solution  and  martensite  transformation  under  dynamic  loading.  Martensitic transformation can commonly beattributed to athermal induction and deformation induction. In respect of athermal induced martensitic transformation, temperature of bulk materials needs to be lowered below Mstemperature rapidly. Whereas,martensitic  transformation  can  commence  above  Mstemperature.  The  chemical driving force for phase transition can be balanced through drastic cooling or external loading. Different shape of martensite (lath, butterfly, lenticular, thin plate) can beformed depending on the temperature while the lath-like martensite tends to appear at highest forming temperature and thin plate tends to appear at lowest forming temperature. Due to its superior mechanical properties including higher strengthen and  strain  hardening  rate  and  high  endurance  limit,  this  novel  HEA  system  is considered to be conducted into wider application including high damping materials and aviation application.

            "output": "1.1 Multicomponent alloysTraditional thought of researches on novel materials mainly obeys rules with combination of specific properties comingfrom different component. The mean goal of developing multicomponent alloys is to achieve balance of engineering properties attributedtodifferent components. Conventional alloyingstrategies of one or two components materials were first discovered by Cantor[25].Besides, materials with several components (three or four) can be described through ternary and quaternary phase diagram[27].1.2 High entropy alloys High-entropy alloys, which are regarded as alloys consistingof five or more elementsequallyor  near  equally,  were  first  discovered  back  in  1980s.  Related theories were further developed by Jien-Wei Yeh in 1990s. The very first fabricated HEA alloy is CrMnFeCoNi alloy, which is also known as “Cantor” alloy. Upon the previous researches, many other high-performance alloys tend to form intermetallic compounds which are undesired in terms of mechanical properties due to its negative influence of distribution of phasessuch as low stability based on Gibbs phase rule. Base on Gibbs phase rule, the increasing of instability of the system is corresponding to the growing number of phases. The equiatomic HEAs have been extensively investigated, therefore, more and more emphasis has been put on the study of non-equiatomic HEAs. The HEAs are mainly divided into two divisions in respect of different matrix phase, composed of BCC and FCC. Significantly more researches have been done on FCC-based HEAs than BCC-based HEAs.Besidesmany high entropy alloys  possess strong temperaturedependence mechanical  behavior. For instance, the FCC Cantor alloy exhibits anincreasing yield strength as temperature decreases at rangesbetween 77 to 500K[8]. In contrast to FCC-based HEAs, much less information and details wasobtainedfor BCC-based HEAs. 1.2.1 Core mechanism of HEA1.2.1.1 Lattice distortionRegularly, atoms should be periodically presenting in a unit cell, in other word, certain atom will locate at specific sites. Whereas, in some special cases, atoms may present atsome unexpected sites. In multiple component alloys, distinct atomic size can generate strain and strain energy. The extent of lattice distortion is closely related to atomic radius difference and Poisson’s ratio 𝜈of materials. In terms of characterization, lattice distortion effect will weaken intensity peaksin XRD due to smaller value of structure factor F. In other aspect of properties, the solid solution hardening is enhanced.1.2.1.2 Sluggish diffusion effectSluggishdiffusioneffect of HEA can be simplified through analysis of binary system instead of quinary system. In comparison with pure metal and stainless steel, diffusion rate in HEA is way slower. Diffusion in materials are strongly dependent required energy to propel migration of atomsdislocations, vacancies and so on.This effect  can  be  manipulated  through  adding  certain  component.  For  example,  the addition  of  Ni  can  greatly  enhance  this  effect  by  generating  higher  activation energies for atom migration.1.2.1.3 High entropy effectThermodynamic properties are closely related to Gibbs energy, enthalpyand entropy. Their relation can be expressed by following equation: G=H-TS. In respect of HEA, this relation can be described in other way: 𝛥𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑥=𝛥𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑥−𝑇𝛥𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑥, where 𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑥 , 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑥and 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑥indicates mixing free energy, mixing enthalpy and mixing  entropy  respectively. 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑥is  strongly  corresponding  to  atomic  size variation. All component in HEA have similar enthalpy which propel a smaller 𝐻𝑚𝑖𝑥. The  mixing  entropy  of 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑥can  be  established  through  calculation 𝑆𝑚𝑖𝑥=𝑅∑𝑥𝑖𝑙𝑛𝑥𝑖𝑛′1, where R and 𝑥𝑖indicates gas constant and atomic ratio respectively. Therefore, due to increasing mixing entropy along with rising number of elements of equimolar alloys, HEA is more stable due to its lower 𝛥𝐺𝑚𝑖𝑥[27].1.2.1.4 Cocktail effectCocktail effect indicates that in HEA with multiple metallic components, the mechanical properties of HEA can easily adjusted by changing composition of one single element. This effect was first discovered by Ranganathan[28].This effect can also be represented by changing the composition of boron in NCATB HEA. For instance, in NCATB HEA, an addition of slim amount (0.05 at%) of boron will propel the formation of Ta2B compound which greatly suppresses 𝛽−𝑁𝑖𝐴𝑙grain boundary precipitates and enhances the ductility."

            "abstract": "TOwing to superior mechanical properties such as high fatigue life and high yield strength of many non-equiatomichigh entropy alloys (HEA), a novel division of non-equiatomic FeNiCoAlTaB (NCATB) HEAs has been introduced. The novel NCTAB HEAs exhibit a very high yield stress which is around 1.1~1.2 GPa with appreciable ductility under quasi-static compression. The strengthening mechanisms in  NCATB-HEA  system  are  strongly  dependent  on  the  grain  precipitates,  solid solution  and  martensite  transformation  under  dynamic  loading.  Martensitic transformation can commonly beattributed to athermal induction and deformation induction. In respect of athermal induced martensitic transformation, temperature of bulk materials needs to be lowered below Mstemperature rapidly. Whereas,martensitic  transformation  can  commence  above  Mstemperature.  The  chemical driving force for phase transition can be balanced through drastic cooling or external loading. Different shape of martensite (lath, butterfly, lenticular, thin plate) can beformed depending on the temperature while the lath-like martensite tends to appear at highest forming temperature and thin plate tends to appear at lowest forming temperature. Due to its superior mechanical properties including higher strengthen and  strain  hardening  rate  and  high  endurance  limit,  this  novel  HEA  system  is considered to be conducted into wider application including high damping materials and aviation application. The strain rate effect on martensitic transformation is also studied  in  current  research.  Microband  is  a  very  common  phenomenon  in  high stacking fault energy material, whereas its formation mechanism remains unclear. Microband formation and its effect on martensitic transformation are also dedicated to study in this research.",

            "output": "3.2.1Powder ProcessingPlanetary  ball  milling  is  a  common  technique  to  break  down  powder  particulates and reducethe grain size. With this technique, jars and balls made of various hard materials such  as  stainless  steel,  agate,  tungsten  carbide,  silicon  nitride,  etc,  are  spun  around  in  a planetary  gear  fashion.  The  jars  are  located  at  the  planetary  gear  positions  where  the rotation  from  the  sun  wheel  combined  with  the  jars  produce  greater  acceleration  than  the individual  gear  positions.  The  repeated  shear  and  impact  forces  between  the  balls  and  jar walls  break  down  the  particulates [29].  Main  parameters  include  the  RPM  of  the  jars, duration,  ball  size,  number  of  balls,  and  ball  to  powder  ratio.  A  Frisch  Premium  Line Pulverisette  7  planetary  ball  mill  with  stainless  steel  balls  and jars  was  used  for  the  work presented in this thesis.The  Mg2Si  starting  powder  was  purchased  from  Alfa  Aesar  with  20  mesh  size  and 99.9%  metals  basis  purity.  The  powder  to  ball  weight  ratio  used  was  1:20  and  4.7  mm diameter  steel  balls  were  used.  The  ballmilling  parameters  used  were  300  RPM  for  6  and 12 hours and 600 RPM for 48 hours. The speed of 600 RPM for 48hours was chosenas an extreme case to check if further powder refinement could be achieved.3.2.2CAPADThe  powder  was  consolidated  inside  graphite  plungers  and  dies. Traditionally,  the CAPAD  uses  a  single  die  setup  for  producing  samples  with  a  diameter  of  19mm.  In  this work, aspecially designed mini system consisting of a small die within a larger die was used to  produce  samples  of  9.5mm  in  diameter.  The  smaller  sized  samples  were  achieved  by fabricating  a  smaller  die  and  plunger  set  that  rests  inside  the  regular  system  as  illustrated by Figure 3.1.  This  allows  for  less  powder  to  be  expended  per  sample.  It  is  particularly useful for determining densification parameters for powders of limited supply where many experiments need to be done.A    typical    CAPAD    experiment    requires    the    application    of    pressure    while simultaneously heating the sample. During the pressure ramp portion, very little current is supplied  to  the  sample  and  dies  so  as  to  not  cause  excessive  stress  from  the  loading  and thermal expansion. Once the desired pressure is reached, the true temperature ramp is put into  effect  as illustrated  by Figure 3.2.  The  particularsetup  uses  an  Instron  model  5584 testing machine. The Instron machine provides precise control over compressive forces and extension. This allows for real time densification monitoring.The starting  powders  were  loaded  into  the  dies  and  first  compacted  at  112 MPa at room temperature for one minute. These green compacts were then processed at 112 MPa of  pressure  with  a  load  rate  of  37.3  MPa/min. The  temperature  ramp  during  this  pressure ramp  was  held  at  a  rate  of  100 °C/min.  Once  the  pressure  stabilized  at  112  MPa, the temperature  ramp  was  increased  to  200 °C/min  until  reaching  the  desired  processing temperature.Two separate hold times were used, 1 and 5 minutes. These hold times began once the sample reached their processing temperatures.Densities were measured using the Archimedes  method  in  ethanol  due  to  the  samples  reactivity  with  water.  The  Archimedes method  relies  on  the  difference  in  object  weight  due  to  the  buoyancy  force  acting  on  a submerged object in a fluid with known properties to calculate density of the object.3.2.3Microstructure AnalysisAnalysis of the powder was aided through the use of a Bruker D8 Advance for x-ray diffraction (XRD) and a Philips FEG XL30 scanning electron microscope (SEM). XRD analysis provided  information  about  both  composition  and  microstructure.  Using  the  Scherrer equation, crystallite size can be estimated from the XRD peak patterns [30]:3.1where χis the mean crystallite size, Kis the shape factor, λis the x-ray wavelength, Bis the full width half maximum (FWHM), and θis the Bragg angle. The  Bragg  angle  at  which  the  peaks occur  can  also  reveal  information  about  the crystal  structure.  If  the  peak  shifts  are  attributed  towards  a  change  in  crystallographic lattice parameters, then the amount of change is calculable using Bragg’s law:3.2where nis an integer of a given order, λis the wavelength of the x-ray, θis the incident angle, and dis the plane spacing. Since Mg2Si crystallizes in a cubic structure, the relationship between plane spacing and lattice parameter takes the form of:3.3where h,k,lare the Miller indices and ais the lattice parameter [30].3.2.4PropertyMeasurementsElectrical  conductivity  of  the  samples  was  measured  using  the  home  built  current source  described  in  Chapter  2.  Samples  were  formed  into  bars  of  known  dimensions  and polished using  a  Buehler  EcoMet  3000  wheel  polisher  and  silicon  carbide  polishing  paper with a final polish of 1μm diamond solution. An alcohol base lubricant was used.Four wires were   then   attached   to   the   bars   to   perform   a   4   point   probe   electrical   resistivity measurement.Seebeck  coefficients  of  the  samples  were  measured  using  the  technique  described by   Tritt [18].   Samples  were   cut   into   bars   (The   bars  used   for   electrical   conductivity measurements  were  also  used  in  the  Seebeck  coefficient  measurements.)  with  a  heater attached to one end and  a heat sink on the other. A strain gauge was used as the heater to produce  joule  heating  while  an  aluminum  block  was  used  as  the  heat sink.Thermocouples and  voltage  leads  were  placed  at  both  ends  to  measure  the  temperature  and  voltage  drop across the sample.Thermal  conductivity  was  calculated  from  the  measured  density,  specific  heat capacity, and measured thermal diffusivity. A custom setup was used for the measurement of thermal diffusivity in accordance with parameters outlined in ASTM C714-85. An infrared laser  with  30W  of  effluence  was  used  to  heat  the  front  of  the  sample.  The  sample  was suspended  in air  by  attaching  a  thermocouple  to  the  backside.  Convection  losses  were minimized by keeping the sample in an enclosed area. The 3ω method was not used due to issues with the heater line micro-fabrication. Thermal conductivity is the summation of the phonon   contribution   and   electron   contribution   among   other   energy   carriers.   The relationship  between  electrical  conductivity  and  electron  thermal  conductivity  is  given  by the Wiedemann-Franz Law.3.4where κeis the electron contribution to thermal conductivity, σ is the electrical conductivity, L is the Lorentz number, and T is the temperature. The Lorentz number used in the calculation was 1.5 x10-8W/S K2for a non-degenerate semiconductor [32]."

In the solid state, complex 2.1 displays anoctahedral environment about the uranium center (O1-U1-O1 = 180.0°). The alkoxide ligands are in the trans configuration as opposed to a cis conformation.

The uranyl bond distances are both 1.791(5) Å, which is typical for uranyl bond distances.30,31The uranium alkoxide bond distances are 2.137(6) Å, which is very similar to the uranyl bis(triphenylphosphine oxide) (TPPO) bis t-butyl alkoxide synthesized by Burns and co-workers, which has an U-OAlkoxidebond distance of 2.143(6)Å.28The coordination environment of the alkoxide and coordinating solvent around the uranyl is typical of UO2R12R22complexes with monodentate ligands.The 1H NMRspectrumof complex 2.1in THF-d8exhibitstworesonances in the phenyl region at 7.14 ppm and 7.70ppm,corresponding to the phenyl protons of the alkoxide ligand.

The slow diffusion of a diethyl-ether solution of 2 equiv of Ph3COH into a diethyl ether/hexanes solution of UO2[N(SiMe3)2]2(THF)2at -25°C results in the deposition of orange plate like crystals(eq 2.5).

In the solid state, complex 2.2exhibits a pseudo-octahedral environment around the uranium center (O5-U1-O6 = 167.9(1)°).  The alkoxide ligands are in a cis configuration as opposed to the trans configuration in complex 2.1. The distortion from an octahedral environment is most likely due to the bulky triphenylmethyl alkoxide ligands being in the cis arrangement. The large steric profile of the triphenylmethyl alkoxide ligands cause a distortion from an octahedral coordination environment and the Et2O and THF areforced closer to each other to reduce the steric pressure around the alkoxides. This configuration is most likely the less favorable of the two, as evidenced by the reconfiguration to the trans configuration upon being dissolved and recrystallized from THF."

The novel NCTAB HEAs exhibit a very high yield stress which is around 1.1~1.2 GPa with appreciable ductility under quasi-static compression. The strengthening mechanisms in  NCATB-HEA  system  are  strongly  dependent  on  the  grain  precipitates,  solid solution  and  martensite  transformation  under  dynamic  loading.  Martensitic transformation can commonly beattributed to athermal induction and deformation induction. In respect of athermal induced martensitic transformation, temperature of bulk materials needs to be lowered below Mstemperature rapidly. Whereas,martensitic  transformation  can  commence  above  Mstemperature.  The  chemical driving force for phase transition can be balanced through drastic cooling or external loading. Different shape of martensite (lath, butterfly, lenticular, thin plate) can beformed depending on the temperature while the lath-like martensite tends to appear at highest forming temperature and thin plate tends to appear at lowest forming temperature. Due to its superior mechanical properties including higher strengthen and  strain  hardening  rate  and  high  endurance  limit,  this  novel  HEA  system  is considered to be conducted into wider application including high damping materials and aviation application.

Uranyl thiolate complexes are extremely rare, and complex 2.3is only the second unsupported unidentate uranyl thiolate synthesized. Unfortunately, through reactivity studies of these complexes it was found that the reductionof complexes 2.1, 2.2and 2.3does not form the desired reverse uranyl or the sulfur substituted reverse uranyl. The reduction of these complexes reduces the uranium center to uranium(IV), while the ligand is removed from the metal and the free alkoxide or thiolate is formed. The use of potassium graphite resulted in the formation of KOCPh3, KSCPH3and the utilization of decamethylcobaltacene resulted in the formation of [CoCp*2][SCPh3](2.4) while decamethylcobaltacene showed no reactivity with complexes 2.1and 2.2. While these complexes did not show the desired reactivity we were able to show that it is easier to reduce offthe alkoxide or thiolate ligands and reduce the metal center than to break the oxygen-carbon or sulfur-carbon bonds.

            "output": "Thereis martensitic transformation occurs in NCATB HEA, more specifically, 𝛾→𝛼′transformation.  This  phenomenon  associates  with  high  strain  rate  with relatively small strain level.(2) During the compression, there is no sign of formation of εmartensite. Higher stability of matrix phase contributes a higher stacking fault energy which causes the absence of εmartensite. At small strain level, high strain rate would be beneficial to nucleation of 𝛼′.(3) Under high strain rate, material behaves with higher yield stress which make it available to surpass the critical for phase transformation. This associates with the strain rate effect on martensitic transformation of NCATB HEA.(4) The precipitate mechanism of NCATB HEA is strongly dependent on the addition of different chemical component.The solid solution phase NiAl3-γ′is a coherent phase with matrix austenite phasewhen precipitate size is under critical value.The size of precipitatesunder 600°C/24h is significantly lower than its critical value which maintains phase coherency.It strengthens the material through increasing required drive force to move dislocation. (5)Grain boundaries precipitates 𝛽−𝑁𝑖𝐴𝑙is observed in NCATB HEA, whose formation can be suppressed by the addition of B.(6) Microbands were observed in specimen. α′martensite seems more favorable to form around microbands."
