            "input": "",         
            "output": " The effective recruitment and retention of ethnically and racially minoritized people has been a long-standing challenge within the field of school psychology (Esquivelet al., 2007). The challenges with recruiting students from underrepresented backgrounds has contributed to a severe lack of representation among school psychologists that is not reflective of theethnically, racially, and linguistically diverse children and families receiving services today (National Associationof School Psychologists, 2009). Despite over 50% of students in U.S. schools being from historically marginalized backgrounds, under 15% of school psychologist are from historically marginalized backgrounds (Goforth et al., 2021). Although the number of raciallyand ethnicallyprofessionals in school psychology has increased over the years, it remains“persistently low” (Fagan, 2004, p. 427).Prior to 1990, non-White school psychologists represented less than 6% of school psychologists (Curtis et al., 1999). From 1990 to 2015, the percentage of minoritized school psychologists only increased from 6% to 7% (Goforth et al. 2021; Castillo et al., 2014). However, by the year 2050, it is expected that 62% of youth will be children of color (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).Therefore, thereis a critical need to increase the number of school psychologists of color in the field to serve youth of color and their families. This starts with addressing the underrepresentation of graduate students of color in school psychology programs. This dissertation study aims to examine self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, hope, and belongingness among Black students who are currently enrolled in graduate school psychology programsto further inform efforts to recruit and retain Black school psychology graduate students.This dissertation study also aims to explore the degree to which the school psychology training domains as set forth by the National Association of School Psychology (NASP) align with Black students’ perceived task value in their role as aspiring school psychologistswith the ultimate goal of further aligning the profession in ways to enhance recruitment and retention efforts.Rationale for the StudyAs the number of school psychologists from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds are among the lowest and slowest changing characteristics in comparison to other branches of psychology (Curtis et al., 2012; Goforth et al., 2016; Fagan, 2004; Proctor et al., 2014), it is critical to expand the literature base that raises awareness of this issue. Recently observed demographics highlight the underrepresentation of both practitioners and faculty from ethnically and racially backgrounds withinthe school psychology workforce, which ispredominantly White and female (Walcott & Hyson, 2018).The most recent American Psychological Association Center for Workforce Study foundthat ethnically and racially minoritizedindividuals comprised 26.4% and 16.7% of full-time faculty in counseling and clinical psychology programs, respectively, whereas there were only 11.8% in school psychology programs (Curtis et al., 2012). When considering the role of school psychologists as key providers of educational and mental health services for increasingly diverse youth, there are compelling advantages to diversifying the workforce. Blake et al. (2016) explained that “having a diverse workforce in school psychology...offers educational benefits to psychologists in training and society as a whole in terms of improving the quality of culturally sensitive mental health service delivery made available to children from disenfranchised groups” (p. 307). Further, Chandler (2011) stated that theshortage of school psychologists from historically underrepresented backgrounds –particularly African American faculty –is a “public health concern” due to the increasing demand to provide quality mental health services to diverse populations (p. 104). In regard to training, research indicates that diversity in communities of higher education broadensstudents’ perception of diversity and promotespositive learning outcomes (Chang, 2002; Pike et al., 2007). Further, students who are enrolled in graduateprograms with people from different cultural backgrounds gain a better understanding of the unique experiences of others,which heightenstheir level of cultural awareness(Newell et al. 2010). Therefore, increasing the number of students from historically marginalized backgrounds in school psychology programs could contribute to a more profound and purposeful experience for school psychology trainees who may potentially become the faculty in school psychology programs. The school psychology studentsfrom ethnically and racially minoritized backgrounds may alsobecome the service providers for diverse youth and families. School psychologists play a key role in providing educational and mental health services to all youth (NASP, 2021; Chandler, 2011). Training in culturally sensitive practices helpsschool psychologistsprovide more effective services to minoritized youth (Jones, 2014). However, there is also value in increasing the accessibility of service providers whoare racially, ethnically, culturally, and linguistically similar to the students being served. A growing body of literature on the potential benefits of racialethnic match and greaterdiversity ofschool-based service providers indicatesthat having a racialethnic match is associated withfewerbehavior problems among youth (Downer et al., 2016);enriched therapeutic relationships (Bernal et al., 2009; Cabral & Smith, 2011);and increased parent participation in prevention trainings (Bates & Glick, 2013). These potential benefits suggest that effective recruitment of school psychologists from underrepresented backgrounds can cultivate a profession that better serves students and their families. The experiences, knowledge, understanding, and worldviews of school psychologists from diverse populations can improve overall “sensitivity, awareness to advocate for, conduct research relevant to, and effectively provide mental health services to children from racial and ethnic minority communities” (Blake et al., 2016, p. 306). This study will specifically focus on considerations for recruiting and retainingBlackschool psychologistsin the field. Importance of the TopicIt is important that the views of Black individuals within school psychology be given more attention throughresearch,especially as it pertains to diversifying the profession. There is a troublesome history of the use of discriminatory assessments, evaluations, and practices that raise concern about the experiences of Black students in the U.S. education system. One example is the Larry P. v. Rilescase that was filed successfully against the state of California in the late 1970’s. The case ensued that the administration of culturally biased standardized intelligencetests(e.g., intellectual quotient tests or IQ tests)resulted in disproportionatenumbers of African American children being identified and inappropriately placed in special education classesfor the educable mentally retarded(EMR)1(Larry P. v. Riles, 1979). More recently, research indicates that Black students continue to be disproportionately categorized with Emotional Disturbance (Aud et al., 2010; Bal et al., 2019; Sullivan & Bal, 2013), and are subjected to segregated special education placements and harsher disciplinary action in schools (Fisher et al., 2020; Skiba et al., 2006; Skiba et al., 2014). Considering that Black students represent 16% of the student population yetcomprise32-42% of the students who faculty are just as uninformed about school psychology as the students. Among the small sample of faculty members who participated, 78% expressed that organizations such as NASP and Division 16 of APAneglected to provide information about school psychology to HBCUs (Graves& Wright, 2009). Also, 64% of the faculty from the HBCU’s who completed the survey reported that there is no active recruitment from school psychology programs and these faculty also believe that there are limited opportunities for Black students in school psychology compared to other subfields of psychology (Graves & Wright, 2009). The disconnect expressed by leaders of the HBCU community toward the field of school psychology is concerning, especially if they do not perceive school psychology as a viable career choice for the students on their campus who are primarily Black. Therefore, it is worthwhile to examine the experiences of Black graduate school psychology students who havechosen to pursue the field as it may have implications for future recruitment efforts. Limited school psychology faculty. The percentage of counseling and clinical psychologists in faculty positions are 17% and 14%, respectively (APA, 2019). Based on data acquired from NASP, under eight percent of school psychologists are employed in university settings while over 80% are employed in school settings (Walcott & Hyson, 2018). However, as school psychology faculty continue to retire and few graduate studentsreport a desire to pursue academic positions, shortages of school psychologists are projected to increase over the next decade (Goforth et al., 2020; Castillo et al., 2014; Clopton & Haselhun, 2009). More specifically, it is predicted that there will be 1,055 unfilled school psychologist positions by 2025 (Castillo et al., 2014). Additionally, only 20% of school psychology programs report having a graduating class of, at minimum, ten students (AAEE, 2020). With there being too few school psychology programs to meet the growing demand for school psychologists, a trickle-down effect is observed. Given that graduate-level courses tend to be smaller, even if more students were recruited, there may not be enough faculty to accommodate more students. Consequently, there remains a lownumberof school psychology faculty that are homogenous in terms of ethnic background, especially given the lack of recruitment from minority-serving institutions such as HBCUs (Graves & Wright, 2009). Thus, continued lack of school psychology faculty plays an integral role in minimizing undergraduate students’ exposure to the field, which contributes to the underrepresentation of Black school psychology faculty. According to the National Center for Education Statistics (2020), 4% of full-time professors and 5% of full-time assistant professors are Black. Also, only 5% of school psychology faculty are Black (Walcott et al., 2018). Moreover, data from NASP indicate that only 3% its members identify as Black or African American (Walcott et al., 2018). However, in a study where researchers aimed to explore the roles and practices of school psychologists working in urban schools, 30% of participants identified as Black or African American(Graves et al., 2014). These notable demographic differences may imply that there are career preferences among Black school psychologistsand that a substantial number of Black or African American school psychologist may not be affiliated with NASP. Truscott et al. (2014) found that Black school psychologists perceived their fundamental roles as advocating for youth of color and being positive representations of people of color. As a result, they may be more likely to seek employment as practitioners to work more closely and deliberately with youth of color than to pursue academia. There may also be challenges associated with availability, access, and perceived value of pursuing a doctorate, which is the requisite entry-level degree for academia, whereas a master’s or specialist degree is sufficient for practice.Social and economic factors. Racial and ethnic disparities in the context of education have been consistently observed and evidenced over centuries (Albee, 1969; Aud et al., 2010; Bal et al., 2019; Sullivan & Bal, 2013). According to APA (2012), educational disparities (or more appropriately, limited opportunities in education), result from differences in social class, biased treatment, and the varied responses to adverse experiences that disproportionately impact racial and ethnic youth. Some of the indicators of social class documented in education include parental socioeconomic status, school demographics, and neighborhood demographics (Aud et al., 2010). Therefore, it could be deduced that lack of equity in education directly affect students of color in terms of limiting their access and exposure to quality educational resources and opportunities (Edyburn et al., 2021). Given that systemic inequities contribute to a lower quality of education, lack of educational opportunity, and lack of employment opportunity (Quintana & Mahgoub, 2016, p. 96), these issues should be considered in the recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented backgrounds.The U.S. Department of Education (2020) indicates that the average cost to attendgraduate school is about $10,000 for in-state students and $30,000 for out-of-state students. The average income for Black families is the lowest at$44,000 compared to the $56,000 for Latino/Hispanic families, $76,000 for White families, and $98,000 for Asian families (U.S. Bureau Labor of Statistics, 2020); this could serve as a barrier to attending graduate school. Black students from low-income families are twice as likely to have education debt due to borrowing loans to pay for graduate school (Grinstein-Weiss et al., 2016). Considering that the median salary of school psychologists is $74,000 (Goforth et al., 2021), Black students may elect to go into careers where they might expect more pay in entry-level positions such as medical, science, technology, engineering, mathematics or even business (Ruder & Van Noy, 2018), to ensure they can repay student loans. Given these looming barriers, it may be difficult for Black students to consider school psychology as a viable career option without proper funding support to be successfully complete their program. Microaggressionsand bias. Before Black and Brown students ever think about attending college, they may face disparate treatment in school. For example, in a meta-analysisby Tennebaum and Ruck (2007), teachers were found to hold higher academic expectationsfor Asian American and White students than Black and Latino students. They were also found to be more supportive and encouraging toward Asian American and White students than Black and Latino students. However, educator bias toward student capabilities ofsuccess based on race and ethnicity is also prominent at the university-level. Lott and Rogers (2011) engaged in a study evaluating the beliefs and experiences of White and ethnically, racially diverseundergraduate psychology majors and they found that although both groups reported similar reasons for selecting psychology as a major, their perceived challenges were different. Students from historically marginalized backgroundswere significantly more likely to report their challenges as being a lack of encouragement or respect from professors and finding inaccurate representations of their ethnic group in textbooks and lectures (Lott & Rogers, 2011). Microaggressions are defined as “brief, everyday exchanges that send denigrating messages to people of color because they belong to a racial minority group” (Sue et al., 2007, p. 273).  With microaggressions being a real and pervasive problem experienced among graduate students of color (Sue et al., 2007; Sue, 2010), the success or retention of Black students in school psychology programs are of concern. For example, Clark et al. (2012) found negative race-related experiences, lower perceptions of belongingness, and lower perceptions of autonomy to be barriers to underrepresented student’s pursuits in graduate school psychology programs. Proctor and Truscott (2012) also found that Black students who exited their school psychology programs reported cultural incongruity, misalignment with professional goals, and negative relations with faculty. Unfortunately, these findings underscore the educational disparities, which act as a microcosm of the systemic and institutional racism that Black and Brown people are forced to endure. Therefore, efforts to progress thefield must be intentionalin challengingthe existingsystemsand ideologies.Motivating Factors of Ethnically and Racially Minoritized Studentsto Pursue School PsychologyIn addition to considering barriers that may impact Black students desire to attend school psychologygraduate programs, it is alsoimportant to highlight potential motivating factors to pursuing an advanced degree in school psychology. Despite there being a dearth of literature regarding the motivations for graduate students’ pursuits of careers in school psychology, one of the studies found that the desire to work with children was one of the more common reasons endorsed (Graves & Wright, 2007). Using a mixed-methodological approach, the researchers surveyed 307 school psychology graduate students about their goals in obtaining a degree in school psychology. Based on a Likert scale, the graduate students rated the various aspects of school psychology that impacted their decision to receive an advanced degree in the field. The qualitative part of the studyalso asked participants open-ended questions pertaining to their reasons for applying to school psychology training programs. The results showed that 92% of the respondents indicated that “working with children” was important or very important in their decision to pursue school psychology. Similarly, the open-ended questions yielded a majority of responses indicating that working with children greatly influenced their decision to apply to school psychology graduate programs. Other studies in whichthe reasons for wanting to work as a school psychologist were assessed further demonstrated that many individuals in the field enjoy helping students, individually and collectively (Graces & Wright, 2007). However, the demographics of students included in the studies are unknown. As a result,much less is known about motivating factors for Black students to pursue school psychology.The challenges for Black students that were previously discussed include a lack of exposure to the field of school psychology, concerns regarding socioeconomic factors, and microaggressions. It is possible that, if some of these barriers were addressed, Black students might be further motivated to pursue school psychology. For example, bridge or pathway programs have been designed by some colleges and universities to expand the pool of successful applicants to specific programs(Pham et al., 2021). Many of the bridge programs focus primarily on diversifying that field of study.Therefore, the creation of a bridge program that provides early and increased exposure of Black undergraduates to school psychology could be a means of motivating them to pursue graduate training programs. As an exemplar, Florida International University, which is a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI),actively recruits over 75% of students from historically marginalized backgroundsinto their school psychology program despite their students reporting being unfamiliar with school psychology in their undergraduate studies (Pham et al., 2021). In regard to socioeconomic factors, increased opportunities for teaching assistantships, departmental grants, or paid practicum experiences could help alleviate some of these financial stressors (Washington et al., 2020). However, the inclusion of social justice and advocacy on behalf of the Black community have been found to beanimportantconsideration among Black graduate students (Miranda et al., 2014; Truscott et al., 2014). Thus, providinginformation and opportunities forBlack students to learn ways they might be able to improve the lives of youth and families in their communities can be strong motivating factors. Yet, because much less is known about the reasons that Black students choose careers in school psychology, this study aims to fill this gap. Through investigating the socio-cognitive factors and alignment of Black students’ perception of NASP domains, this study will expand the literature seeking to improve the recruitment and retention of Black students in school psychology graduate training programs. Major Research Questions and HypothesesThe major aim of this dissertation study is to better understand perceived experiences of Black graduate school psychology students. The overall goal is to better understand the social and cognitive factors that are related to Black graduate students’ perception of their academic pursuits in school psychology. Specifically, this study will explore self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, hope, and belonginess in Black graduate school psychology students to better understand how to improve recruitment strategies for Black school psychologists. Thesesocio-cognitivefactors will be examined for their ability to predict career satisfaction and will also provide a critical lens for evaluating the unique barriers faced by Black students in the field.  Prior research indicates that there exists a correlation betweenself-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value and career satisfaction (Lent et al., 1994). Belongingness has also been found to have a positive correlation with self-efficacy (Goodneow & Grady,1993). However, theeffect of hope and belongingness onself-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task valuehave not been explored. Comparatively, the evaluation of Black graduate school psychology students’ perceived alignment with NASP training domains hasnot been directly explored and can provide valuable information about how to improve retention. Therefore, it is useful to use the NASP training domains as a measure of whether Blackgraduate school psychologystudents perceive the field’s goals align with their own professional goals. The specific research questions and hypotheses of this study are: RQ1:Are self-efficacy, outcome expectations,task value, hope, and belongingnesssignificant predictors of Black graduateschool psychology students’careerchoice satisfaction?H1:Self-efficacy, outcome expectations,task value, hope, and belongingnessare significant predictors of Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction.

H0:Hope and belongingness do not mediatethe relation between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, and Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction.Research Design and VariablesIn this study a quantitative approach using a non-experimental, cross-sectionaldesign was applied. A review of relevant literature revealed that quantitative studiesfocusing on Black students in graduate school psychology programs were limited and couldbe relevant in expanding recruitment efforts (Chandler, 2011; Pham et al., 2021; Proctor & Truscott, 2012). Non-experimental research is an approach that neither relies on the manipulation of variables nor assigns participants to treatmentconditions (Bonds-Raacke & Raacke, 2014). This type of research examines how thevariables in the study are related to one another, explores phenomena in real lifesituations, and studies the variables in the study as they exist (Bonds-Raacke& Raacke, 2014). This design was appropriatefor this study because there was no intent tomanipulate the variables, as with experimental research (Bonds-Raacke & Raacke, 2014). The focus was to examine the relations between self-efficacy, outcome expectations,andtask valueamong Black graduate students in school psychology programs.Cross-sectional research is an approach where researchers explore the factorswithin a particular population at a given point in time (Bethlehem, 1999). This design was also appropriate for this study as the focus is to collect and examinedata surrounding the experiences of the participants.ParticipantsRecruitmentIn this study, eligible participants werestudents who self-identifiedas Black or African American (or endorsedCaribbean or African heritage) currently enrolled in graduate school psychology programs. Participants should also be actively matriculating in their school psychology training program.Sample SizeA power analysis was performedusing G*Power software to determine the target sample size for the analysis. The power analysis was conducted for a multiple linear regression with five predictors and assumed a medium effect size (f2=0.15), a significance level of .05, and a power level of .80. The results of the power analysis showed that the target sample size for this analysis was 92 participants. Description of Study ParticipantsParticipants consistedof 112 self-identifying Black students currently enrolled in school psychology programs.Among the participants, 45.5% (n=51) reported their age being between 25 to 29, 25.9% (n=29) were between 18 to 24, 22.4% (n=25) were between 30 to 34, 3.5% (n=4) were between 35 to 39, and 2.7%(n=3) were 40 and over. Most of the sample identified as African American or Black (n=74, 66%). Some participants also identified as other Mixed Race or nationalities such as Haitian American and Middle Eastern (n=25, 22.4%). The remaining participants identified as Afro-Caribbean or West Indian (n=4, 3.5%), Multiethnic (n=4, 3.5%), African (n=3, 2.7%), and Afro-Latino/a/x (n=1, 0.9%) with one participant missing this data. For the participants’ highest degree earned, 50.9% (n=57) had earned a master’s degree, 45.5% (n=51) had earned a bachelor’s degree, 1.8% (n=2) had earned a doctorate, and the remaining 1.8% either earned an associate degree (n=1) or endorsed earning some degree (n=1) other than those listed. Most of the participants self-identified as female (e.g., woman, female, cis-gender female) at 90.0% (n=100) whereas only 9.1% (n=11) self-identified as male. As it relates to marital status, 83.0% (n=93) of participants were single, 14.3% (n=16) were married or in a domestic partnership,and 2.7% (n=3) were divorced. Of the participants who reported their family’s household income, 31.3% (n=35) made less than $25,000, 20.5% (n=23) made between $25,000 to $34,999, 20.5% (n=23) made between $35,000 to $59,999, 14.3% (n=16) made between $60,000 to $99,999 and 4.5% (n=5) made between $100,000 to $149,000, and 3.6% (n=4) made over $150,000. 5.4% (n=6) of the participants did not know or preferred not to respond to this question.See Table 1. Additional demographic data shows that most of the of participants 65.2% (n=73) endorsed that they use loans to fund their current education program. Regarding assistantships and fellowships, 50% (n=56) of the participants endorsed receiving this type of funding. Of the participants who endorsed receiving scholarships or grants to fund their program, 41.1% (n=46) endorsed this type of funding. Most of the participants in the study were enrolled in doctoral programs (45.5%, n=51), 33% (n=37) were enrolled in specialist programs, and 18.8% (n=21) were enrolled in masters’ programs. of the participants who endorsed being in “Other” types of programs each filled in that they were enrolled in hybrid masters and specialist programs. The majority of participants’ school psychology programs were accredited by both NASP and APA (57.1%, n=64) with 34.8% (n=39) being accredited by NASP only2. Also, only 16.1% (n=18) of participants attended HBCUs for their undergraduate degree and 8.9% (n=10) currently attend an HBCU. See Table 2.wasmade available to the first 100 participants who completedthe forms. This monetary incentive was made possible thanks to awards from the Kennedy/Graves Research Fund.InstrumentsDemographic QuestionnaireThe demographic questionnaire wasused to collectbasic demographic data about participants. Thisincludedquestions about the participants’ age, racial, ethnic, or cultural background, gender,highest degree earned, maritalstatus, family household income, and how they fund their current education program. Participants werealso asked about the type of school psychology program they were enrolled in, their programs accrediting organization, andwhetherthey attended an HBCU as an undergraduate or are currently enrolled at anHBCU.Self-efficacy ScaleThe New General Self-Efficacy Scaleassesses the extent to which an individual believes they can achieve their goals despite challenges. The scale has eight items with responses being on a 5-point Likert scale indicating1 = “strongly disagree”, 2 = “disagree”, 3 = “neither agree nor disagree”, 4 = “agree”, or 5 = “strongly agree”. Some examples of the items on the scale are “I will be able to achieve most of the goals that I set for myself” and “When facing difficult tasks, I am certain I will accomplish them”. There exist several measures of self-efficacy. However, the New General Self-Efficacy Scale developed by Chen et al. (2001) demonstrates greater reliability and validity than other measures of self-efficacy (Scherbaum et al., 2006).In prior studies, the internal consistency reliability was found to be high for the New General Self-Efficacy Scale with alpha = .86 and .90 when administrated subsequently.In the current study, Cronbach’s alpha = .83,indicating good reliability.The overall score is calculated by taking the average of participants'ratings with higher score being interpreted as endorsing a higher sense of general self-efficacy. The mean score on the scale was 4.36 (SD=0.49), indicating that, on average, participants agreed with the items. Table C.1 (Appendix C)summarizesthe descriptive statistics for the eight items on the New General Self-Efficacy Scale. Outcome ExpectationsScaleThe outcome expectations scale used in this study indicates whether students have positive outcome expectations for graduating with a degree in school psychology and is a slightly modified version of Lent et al.’s (2008) version.The scale was modified to focus specifically on school psychologyas opposed to the computing sciences. The question on this scale reads as “Graduating with a degree in school psychology will likely allow me to...”. Theoutcome expectationsscale has ten items with responses being on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree”, 2 = “disagree”, 3 = “neither agree nor disagree”, 4 = “agree”, or5= “strongly agree”. The scale scores were created by calculating the mean of the scale with higher values being interpreted as greater positive outcome expectations for graduating with a degree in school psychology.An example of questions included inthe scale are, “Graduating with a degree in school psychology will likely allow me to earn an attractive salary”and “Graduating with a degree in school psychology will likely allow me to do work that can make a difference in people’s lives”.Lent et al. reported a coefficient alpha of .90 for their instrument. Bocanegra et. al (2016) adapted the scale to specifically evaluate participants outcome expectations for graduating from a school psychology program. Bocanegra et al. also reported a coefficient alpha of .90. In the current study, Cronbach’s alpha was = .76 indicating acceptable reliability. The overall outcome expectations score wascalculated and used to predict Black graduate school psychology students’ career choice satisfaction. The mean score on this scale was 4.19 (SD=0.45). Table C.2 (Appendix C)displaysdescriptive statistics for the Outcome Expectations Scale. Subjective Task Value Questionnaire Thesix-itemSubjective TaskValue Questionnaireevaluatesa person’s judgment of how interesting, useful, and important course contents or specific activities are to that individual. The responses of participants werebased on their level of agreement with the following statements using a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree”, 2 = “moderately disagree”, 3 = “disagree”, 4 = “neither agree nor disagree”, 5 = “agree”, 6 = “moderately agree”,and7 = “strongly agree”. Examples of items included on the questionnaire are “I think I will be able to use what I learn in this degree program in my life” and “I am very interested in the content area of my degree program”. The Subjective Task Value Questionnaire is a tool that was adapted from the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ; Pintrich et al., 1991).Pintrich et al. (1991) reported a coefficient alpha of .87 for the six-item task value subscale that measures the beliefs of students regarding task value to them. In the current study, Cronbach’s alpha was found to = .89 indicating goodreliability. The overall subjective task value score wase calculated and used to predict Black graduate school psychology students’ degree of satisfaction with their career choice. The mean score on this scale was 6.25 (SD=0.86). Table C.5 (Appendix C) summarizesdescriptive statistics for the six items on the Subjective Task Value Questionnaire. Alignment with NASP Domains.NASP (2021) has recently revised the ten domains within its comprehensive and integrated services model which guide school psychologists to best meet the needs of students, families, and communities. The ten domains are listed as follows: •Domain 1 –Data-Based Decision-Making•Domain 2 –Consultation and Collaboration•Domain 3 –Academic Interventions and Instructional Supports•Domain 4 –Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions,•Domain 5 –School-Wide Practices to Promote Learning•Domain 6 –Services to Promote Safe and Supportive Schools•Domain 7 –Family, School, and Community Collaboration•Domain 8 –Equitable Practices for Diverse Student Populations•Domain 9 –Research and Evidence-Based Practice•Domain 10 –Legal, Ethical, and Professional PracticeFor each domain, participants were asked to rate the degree to which they feltaligned withthe domain on a scale of 1 = “No Alignment”, 2 = “Poor Alignment”, 3 = “Moderate Alignment”, 4 = “Strong Alignment”, or 5 = “Full Alignment”. The inclusion of this brief questionnaire helpsto understand which aspects of the work Black school psychology student’s value most or least in their training. These responses will be beneficial in further development of recruitment strategies that may be specifically aimed at increasing representation of Black students in school psychology. The mean for this questionnaire was 4.34 (SD=0.59). Table C.6 (Appendix C)displays descriptive statistics for the ten item NASP Domain Alignment questionnaire. Adult (Trait) Hope ScaleThe Adult (Trait) Hope Scale(AHS; Snyder et al., 1991) is a 12-item, self-report inventory that measures dispositional hope in individuals ages 15 and older (Snyder, 2000). The scale is comprised of: (1) four items measuring agency, (2) four items measuring pathways, and (3) four distracter (filler) items. The four agency items focus on one’s sense of successful determination in relation to their goals, while the four pathways’ items focus on one’s cognitive appraisals of their ability to produce means for both overcoming goal-related obstacles and reaching their goals. The four distracter items were omitted in this study to reduce the number of items participants were required to respond to. Participants respond to an 8-point, Likert scale ranging from 1 = “definitely false” 2 =“mostly false”, 3 = somewhat false”, 4 = “slightly false”, 5 = “slightly true”, 6 = “somewhat true”, 7 = “mostly true”, and 8 = “definitely true”.The Cronbach’s alpha for the scale in the current study indicated good reliability alpha = .88. The overall hope score wascalculated and used to predict Black graduate school psychology students’ satisfaction with their career choice. The mean score for this scale was 6.63 (SD=0.99). Descriptive statistics for the Adult Trait Hope Scale are summarized in Table C.7 (Appendix C).Sense of Belonging SurveyThe Sense of Belonging Survey used in this study measures the degree to which students feel they belong on their campuses and was adapted by O’Meara et al. (2017) from the sense of belonging construct and items that are included in the multi-institutional study of leadership (MSL). The MSL (2017) is a multi-year study that focuses on evaluating student needs in higher education.There are seven survey items with responses based on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 = “strongly disagree”, 2 = “disagree”, 3 = “neither agree nor disagree”, 4 = “agree”, and 5 = “strongly agree”. Some examples of the items include “The sense of fit between my values and those of my department/unit” and “I feel valued as a person in my department/unit”. In previous studies, the coefficient alpha for the sense of belonginess items was.86. In the current study, alpha was .81. The overall sense of belongingness score was calculated and used to predict Black graduate school psychology students’ career satisfaction. The mean for this survey was 3.74 (SD=0.71). Descriptive statistics for the Sense of Belongingness Survey are summarized in Table C.3 (Appendix C).Career Choice Satisfaction QuestionnaireThe Career Choice Satisfaction items used in this study wasmodified from Kovach Clark et al.’s (2009) study which predicted burnout and career choice satisfaction among counseling psychology graduate students. The modified scale focused on the field of school psychology rather than counseling psychology. The seven items included to assess career choice satisfaction requiredrespondents to rate each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 = “very dissatisfied or very unlikely”, 2 = “moderately dissatisfied or moderately unlikely disagree”, 3 = neither dissatisfied nor satisfied”, 4 = “moderately satisfied or moderately likely”, and5 “very satisfied or very likely”. Some examples of the item on the questionnaire are “How satisfied are you with your choice of school psychology as a career?” and “How likely is it that you will make a career change outside of school psychology?”. One item (“How likely is it that someday you will make a career change outside of schoolpsychology?”) wasreverse scored so that higher numbers indicatedless likelihood of career change. In the current study, Cronbach’s alpha was equal to .79, indicating good reliability. The mean score for this questionnaire was 4.12 (SD=0.62). Descriptive statistics for the Career Choice Satisfaction Questionnaireare summarized in Table C.4 (Appendix C).Data AnalysesThe data weredownloadedas an electronic spreadsheet file from Qualtrics and imported into SPSS for analysis. Composite scores werecomputed for each research variable (self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, hope, belongingness, and career choice satisfaction) according to the instrument authors’ instructions. Descriptive statistics werecalculated for each of the research variables and demographic variables. Means and standard deviations werecomputed for continuous variables, and frequencies and percentages werecomputed for categorical variables.The research questions wereaddressed using multiple regression analysis via theHayes (2017) PROCESS macro in SPSS. Multiple regression was anappropriate statistical analysisto determine if multiple predictor variables wererelated to thedependentvariable and if any variables mediatedthoserelationships(Baron & Kenny, 1986). In this analysis, the predictor variablesareself-efficacy, outcome expectations,andtask value;the dependentvariable is career choice satisfaction;and the mediatingvariablesarehope and belongingness.The analysis wasconducted using a series of regressions."

            "output": "Prior to proceeding with the mediation analysis, a secondary multiple linear regression model was conducted to evaluate whether self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task value predicted hope or belongingness, respectively. The results show that 48.1%of the variance in hope can be accounted for by the three predictors collectively. Yet, self-efficacy and task value were significant positive predictors of hope, whileoutcome expectation was not a significant a significant predictor. Further, self-efficacy, task value, and outcome expectations were not significant predictors of belongingness. Previous research shows that self-efficacy and hope account for significant variance in academic performance (Adelabu, 2008). As such, the results of this regression indicatethat individuals with a higher senseof self-efficacy also endorse a higher degree of hope. Belongingnessdid not have any relation to self-efficacy, task value, and outcome expectations. Although previous studies have shown belonging to play a role in career interest among underrepresented students, it remains unclear how sense of belonging impacts career choice satisfaction. There is also limited evidence related to understanding how sense of belonging operates to affect cognitive factors, such as task value and outcome expectations, that influence career choice among students in school psychology.  It was expected that self-efficacy might influence sense of belonginess given that belonging is considered to be an important contributor to achievement and motivation (Finn& Frone, 2004).Nevertheless, these insignificant findings have implications that may help researchers craft more meaningful contextual questions, which will be discussed further in the implications. Hope and Belonginess Show No Evidence of Mediation Between Self-Efficacy, Task Value, Outcome Expectations and Career Choices ResearchQuestion 1Bexplored whether hope or belongingness mediated therelation between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task valuewith career choice satisfaction among Black graduate school psychology students. The findings yielded that hope accounted for no more than 4% of the indirect effectobservedbetween self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, and career choice satisfaction. Further, sense of belonging accounted for no more than 1% of the indirect effect observed between self-efficacy, outcome expectations, task value, and career choice satisfaction.These results indicate that despite self-efficacy and task value being predictors of hope, hope as a mediating variable did not show any significant link between these predictorvariables and the dependent variable, career choice satisfaction. Additionally, task value and outcome expectations were found to significantly predict career choice satisfaction independent of hope. Belongingness also showed no significant link between the independent variables and the outcome variables. Given these findings, hypothesis 1B is not supported. Previous studies have found hope toact as a protective factor for students from marginalized backgrounds (Hirsch et al., 2012). The literature that specifically targets graduate students provides further evidence that hope may assist in helping graduate students to overcome the demands of higher education and coping with its challenges (Alexander & Onwuegbuzie, 2007;Kennedy et al., 2009).The current studyaimed to understand the role of hope in relation to career choice satisfaction and expand the literature in this regard, which is not typical in research related to career and vocational interests. Similarly, the context of belonginess in this study may function differently from previous studies where it is shown to play a role in students’ academic experiences. Therefore, although the results were not significant, it helps understand future directions needed within research,especially in the realm of recruitment and retention of students in school psychology. As such, future research may focus on the degree of support students perceive from faculty in their program to meet their goals. This would be more relevant to exploring reasons students may choice to remain in the field of school psychology. Black Graduate School Psychology Students’ Perceived Alignment with NASP Domains of Practice In this study, participants were asked about the degree to which they perceived alignment with the ten NASP Domains.To explore Black graduate school psychology students’ responses to this survey, descriptive statistics were analyzed for each item on the survey. The findings showed that the highest perceived alignment is with Domain 8 -Equitable Practices for Diverse Student Populationsacross participants. Previous research has focused on alignment with actual and desired roles across the NASP Domains among practicing school psychologists(Petereit, 2020).It was found that most school psychologists desired to spend most of their time with Domain4 –Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions. However, the current study makes a unique contribution to the scant literature based in the field of school psychology by focusing on graduate students and on Black graduate students who are underrepresented in the profession. These findings are important to understand the values of Black students in school psychology and may help direct the types of supports these students may need or find helpful as they matriculate in their program.Students in specialist school psychology programs generally endorsedfullalignment across each of the ten NASP Domains. However, specialist and doctoral students alike, endorsed the full alignment, specifically, with Domain 4 –Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions, Domain 5 –School Wide Practices to Promote Learning, and Domain 6 -Services to Promote Safe and Supportive Schools. Doctoral school psychology students endorsed a high degree of alignment with Domain 3 –Academic Interventions and Instructional Supports. Overall, the descriptive statistics of alignment with the NASP domains show master’s students as having the low means, indicating poor to moderate alignment. Further, descriptive statistics show that specialist school psychology students endorsed high levels of career choice satisfaction with school psychology.Overall, participants in this study endorsed the highest level of alignment with Domain 8 –Equitable Practices for Diverse Student Populations. However, further exploration revealed that aside from Domain 8, doctoralstudents endorsed the highest levels of alignment with Domain 4–Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions,whereas master’s students endorsed the highest levels of alignment with both Domain 4–Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions and Domain 6 –Services Promote Safe and Supportive Schools.Therefore, doctoral programs seeking to recruit and retain Black students may need to make concerted efforts to highlight the work being done in Domain 8 and Domain 4. Although it is pertinent to recruit more students at the doctorate level to contribute to diversification of faculty, similar efforts should also be made to diversify recruitment within masters school psychology programs. These findings contribute to the literature on graduate school psychology studentsand their views on NASP standards. Also, studies have not differentiated between program types of school psychology students. Given that there are some differences in the training that students receive in these programs, these findings are crucial to program recruitment. Based on NASP (2017),entry level into the profession of school psychology requires a specialist degree, which suggests that although one may have a master’s degreein school psychology, they still may not be eligible to practice without a credential in their state. Theremay be noteworthy experiential or educational differences among school psychology students that are important considerations for recruitment in the field.LimitationsAlthough this study contributes to the literature on Black graduate students in school psychology programs, there are some limitations to be discussed. These limitations include the research design,study, sample size, bias, and participant demographics. Research DesignThe methodological approach used in this study was quantitative in nature. Although items related to demographics allowed the submission of open-ended responses, a mixed-method approach could have strengthened the results of this study. The research that has focused on graduate school psychology students use quantitative approaches and some have primarily utilized qualitative methods.The benefits of quantitative research are noted to be its objectivity as it relates to making observations, measurements, and quantifiable steps to replicate studiesthat generate important empirical information (Creswell, 2014).Because larger sample sizes are typically essential for quantitativemethods, there is also an inclination to deem this research more reliable, valid, and rigorous than qualitative methods (Hanzel, 2011).Yet, there may lack depth in terms of gaining a deeper understanding of individual experiences or social phenomena (Rahman, 2017).Conversely, qualitative research allows participants to share their experiences and enables researchers the opportunity to clarify their shared experiences to produce findings (Creswell, 2007; Rahman, 2017). The data collection and analysisusing qualitative methodsare centered around a holistic approach to explore human behavior,social interactions, and human choice (Choy, 2014). However, the generalizability of findings is concerning. A mixed-method approach to this type of research wouldmitigate the weaknesses of either methodological approach to provide a moredetailed contextualized insights while maintaining some degree of external validity (Creswell, 2014).Another limitation that is important to point out isthat the theoretical bases of this study may not be applicableconsidering the selected sample. More specifically, SCCT may not be as relevant to graduate students whohave, presumably, already decidedto pursue school psychology as a career. The study completed by Bocanegra et al. (2016) focused on applying SCCT to the experiences ofminority undergraduate studentsand their exposure, or lack thereof,to the field of school psychology as viable career choice. Other studies thathave utilizedSCCT as a theoretical foundation have focused on undergraduate students (Byars-Winston & Rogers, 2019; Bocanegra et al., 2016; Muwonge et al., 2017)or those who were still exploring their options for their studies at the college level career (Carrico & Tendhar, 2012).Therefore, it may be important to consider developing surveys specifically for graduate students in particular fields of study, such as school psychology. As previously mentioned, using qualitative methods could also be advantageous to capture more nuanced or contextual information about these students’ experiences.Sample SizeOne of the limitations of the study is the relatively small sample size of the participants. As outlined in the methods section, data were collected online via a self-report survey. Out of the 150 respondents who agreed to participate in the study by selecting “Agree” on the consent form page, 38 did not complete one or more of the instruments in the study. Upon completing a listwise deletion of these cases from the dataset, a final sample of 112 participants remained. Although the power analysis indicated that a sample size of 92would be sufficient to power to detect medium effects, and 112 participants were included in the study, this remains a small number considering the quantitative analyses conducted. Although the study sample allowed the experiences of self-identified Black school psychology students from across theAfrican diaspora to be evaluated, the sample does not allow for subgroup differences or similarities to be examined. It is possible that in a larger sample size, variancecould have been increased, measurement invariance could have been tested across subgroups, andmore significance could have been found among the variables.Additionally, despite persistent recruitment efforts over nearly four months that were allocated for data collection, the study still resulted in a smaller sample size. The smaller sample size, however, could be attributed to the small number of Black-identifying students enrolled in school psychology programs. The number of items within the study could have also shaped the rate of participants’ responses to the survey. The Qualtrics (2022) system estimated that it took about 22 minutes for participants to complete the survey and surveys that take any longer than nine minutes show substantial levels of respondent break-off especially on mobile devices.Considering that there were demographic questions and seven measures embedded in the survey,the length of time it might take to complete the survey could have served as a barrier for some participants(Podsakoff et al., 2003).BiasGiven that the study utilized participantsself-report data, it is important to consider that there may be some bias in their responses to items. Participants of this study not only had a specific or high interest in the topic of the study buthad a genuine desire to share their experiences as well.The recruitment for this study was specifically targeted toward school psychology students so this is expected. Yet, it is important to note that responses may have been different if participants were recruited more broadly. For example, results may have differed if recruitment included students enrolled in any graduate programas opposed to solely school psychology programs.Given the survey-based nature of the study, the halo effect (i.e., a cognitive bias where there is a tendency to form a general impressionbased upon a single factor, Creswell, 2003)and social desirability bias (i.e., biased thoughts and opinionsabout subsequent items in a questionnaire that are based impressions from previous items, Lavrakas, 2008)both could have impacted the results.However, this is typically expectedwithin the context of collecting self-report data.ParticipantsAnother limitation of the study includes demographic information from participants regarding the type of school psychology programs they were enrolled in. The responseoptions fortypes of school psychology programwere: “Doctoral (Psy.D., Ph.D., Ed.D.)”, “Masters(M.A., M.S., M.Ed.)”, “Specialist(Ed.S., M.A., M.S., CAS, CAGS, Psy.S.), or “Other (please specify)”which gave participants the option to provide anopen-ended response.Three of the participants in the study selected “Other (please specify)” and input task value were significant predictors of career choice satisfaction. Further research may seek to directly explore the career goals and aspirations of Black graduate school psychology students. It may also be poignant to pose questions about these students’ perceived barriers in achieving stated career goals and aspirations. Some of the potentialbarriers for Black graduate students’pursuit of school psychology includelimited exposure to the field, limited school psychology faculty, social and economic factors, and microaggressions. The findings of this study indicatethat Black graduate school psychology studentsgenerally endorsed high levels of hope,which align with prior researchwhich show thathope is higher in minority students (Adelabu, 2008; Snyder, 2000). Considering the role of hope as a protective factor(Hirsch, et al., 2012), futureresearch might aim toexploreother protective factorsthat may act against barriersfor Black school psychology graduate students. In positive psychology, it has been found that graduate studentswithgrowth mindsetstake initiative and believe that hard work determine success more than intelligence alone(Hochanadel & Finamore, 2015).Therefore, it would be interesting to explore the mindsets of Black students in school psychology programswhich mightinclude investigatingresilience or even imposter syndrome(Stone et al., 2018). However, it is equally important to add to the literature and explicitly evaluate barriers perceived by current Black graduate school psychology students. A study conducted by Proctor and Truscott (2012)found that attrition of Black studentsin schoolpsychology programs waslinked to misalignment with students’ career goals, perceived job role restraint as it relates to special education placement, and poor relationships with faculty. Another studyfound that Black students in school psychology often seek mentors outside of their school psychology program due to issues with microaggressions or a color-blind ideology from mostly White faculty (Graves et al., 2019).The current study explored hope and belongingness as socio-cultural factors that may serve as barriers or have implications for career choice satisfaction. Yet, the concepts and items used were broader in scope. It may be beneficial to focus specifically on the types of experiences unique to underrepresented students who areenrolled in school psychology programs. Moreover, approaching future research using mixed methodologies that include interviewing, open-ended responses, andmultiple-choice questions mayprovide deeper insights.

            "abstract": "There is a critical need to diversify the field ofschool psychology to better serve the educational and mental health needsof ethnically and racially minoritizedyouth and their families. This dissertation study focuses specifically on increasing the representation of Black school psychologists. Previous literature shows that Black youth have been historically marginalized and discriminated against in the U.S. system of education. Therefore, increasing representation of Black school psychologistsis critically important tobetter serve Black youth.In striving to increase the recruitment and retention of Black school psychologists, this study aims to provide an understanding about the reasons why Black students choose school psychology and whether they are satisfied with their training. Using multiple regression analysis,this studyexaminedself-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task valueas variables predicting career satisfaction among Black graduate school psychology students. Results indicated that outcome expectations and task value were significant predictors of career choice satisfaction. Hope and belongingness did not mediate the relation between self-efficacy, task value outcome expectations, and career choice satisfaction. Exploratory analyses were also conducted on alignment with NASP Domains and observed across doctoral, masters, and specialist students. Implications for research and practice within the field of school psychology are discussed.",

            "output": "The recruitment and retention of ethnically and racially minoritized professionals in school psychology is an important topic. With the rising number of diverse student populations in the U.S. (Goforth et al., 2021), it is critical that continued research and practices in school psychology remain responsive to an inevitable need to increase representation among its service providers. The current study provides insights about the perceptions of Black graduate school psychology students about career choice satisfaction, which is lacking in the literature. Future directions might further explore thesocio-cognitive factors included in this study, such as self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and task value. However, it is necessary to continue to expand this branch of research to a more critical lens for understanding how to progress the field forward. Overall, there is a need to address the social, political, and systemic issues that may impede recruitmentor shifts in the paradigm or practices in school psychology. Also, the types of tasks that underrepresented student’svalue and the types of outcomes they aspire toward post-graduation will be meaningful to advance these conversations toward action-oriented steps for improvement. Although the findings of this study can expand the current knowledge about students’ intentions in pursuing school, there iscertainly more work to be done in this regard."
