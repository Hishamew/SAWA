            "output": "In  this  chapter,  the  topic  of  exploration  is  cathode-directed  pulsed  nanosecond  discharge(PND) ignition,  in which a pair of electrodes in a combustion chamber receive a series oflarge and fast voltage pulses.  As mentioned in Chapter 2, this increases the reduced electricfieldE/nbetween  the  electrodes,  pushing  electrons  from  the  anode  to  the  ground  cath-ode through narrow (∼100μm) channels henceforth referred to asstreamers(Ono and Oda,2003).  These electrons are at much higher temperatures than the neutral molecules and ions,forming a non-thermal plasma (Fridman, 2008c) and activating alternative kinetic pathwaysto  facilitate  the  ignition  of  dilute  fuel-air  mixtures  (Starikovskaia,  2006;  Starikovskiy  andAleksandrov, 2013; Ju and Sun, 2015; Aleksandrov et al., 2009).  As discussed in Chapter 2,the chemical kinetics of these alternative ignition pathways are a topic of active research andmany mechanisms have been proposed for a variety of reduced electric field regimes (Alek-sandrov  et  al.,  2009;  Kosarev  et  al.,  2008;  Uddi  et  al.,  2009;  Bisetti  and  El  Morsli,  2012;Adamovich et al., 2015; DeFilippo and Chen, 2016).  However, compounding hydrodynamiceffects from a pulsed discharge in breakdown regimes poses issues for practical ignition inautomotive engines, which must operate at a variety of dilution, speeds, and loads, corre-sponding to a large range of mixtures, residence times, and ignition pressures, respectively.As  mentioned  in  Chapter  2,  various  PND  systems  have  been  observed  to  improve  theperformance and extend the dilute operating limits of internal combustion engines (Catheyet  al.,  2007;  Shiraishi  et  al.,  2009;  Pancheshnyi  et  al.,  2014;  Tropina  et  al.,  2016).   Re-cently,  some  of  these  systems—in  conjunction  with  novel  electrode  geometries—have  alsobeen shown to reduce flame development times in engines using both E85 (Sj ̈oberg et al.,2014) and gasoline (Sevik et al., 2016), leading to improved dilute operation performance.  Inthe E85 investigation, high-speed (20 kHz) imaging inside of the cylinder suggests that thedeveloping flame kernel is jettisoned into the combustion chamber.  The turbulent flow fieldinside of the engine precludes a definite conclusion as to why this jettison effect occurs, and somore fundamental experiments are needed to explain the combustion enhancement.  Thoughthere have been many experimental investigations of PND ignition in constant volume cham-bers, most utilize relatively simple electrode geometries such as plate electrodes (Aleksandrovet al., 2009; Kosarev et al., 2008; Uddi et al., 2009; Kosarev et al., 2016; Nagaraja et al.,2013), concentric electrodes (Singleton et al., 2011), or pin-to-pin electrodes (Lovascio et al.,2017) with which convenient numerical model comparisons can be made (Takana et al., 2014;Castela et al., 2016).  Few experiments have been carried out to characterize the physics ofcombustion  enhancement  observed  in  the  types  of  electrodes  expected  to  be  used  in  au-tomotive  engines,  for  which  modeling  investigations  are  hindered  by  the  large  separationbetween  non-thermal  plasma  and  hydrodynamic  timescales.   This  short  study  documentshydrodynamic aspects of PND ignition in lean premixed methane-air mixtures and providesan explanation for the enhancements seen in the aforementioned engine experiments."

            "output": "We studied human and wildlife activity in and around the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL; N 38.9585336,W 106.9899337)overa five-week period in June-August2020. This data collection period captured the start of peak tourism season to examine varying levels of human visitation. We surveyed mammalian activitynear hiking and biking trails by placing camera traps along trails. We quantified how humans influencedthe habitat use of mid-sized and large mammals as a function of human visitation rate and activity type with occupancy models to estimatespecies occupancy while correcting for imperfect detection(Mackenzie et al. 2002; Bailey and Adams 2005).We included five hiking and biking trails in this study: Deer Creek(N 38.945534, W 106.981061), Trail 401(N 38.964142, W 106.988587), Trail 403(N 38.982264, W 107.007438), Kettle Ponds Road(N 38.953452, W 106.988142), and Avery Mountain(N 38.966412, W 106.993313). This setincludes trails that are frequently used for allactivities, trails that are off limits to bikers, trails that are infrequently visited and only by hikers, and wide trails with motorized vehicle access.This site presents an excellent opportunity to study wildlife habitat use near trails with varying activities and heterogeneous impact intensities.The shortest trail, Kettle Ponds Road, is approximately 1500 m long, so we placed cameras along the first 1500 m of each trail to standardizethe camera spacing among all the trails. We used a total of 30 cameras, placing six cameras on each of the five trails using a stratified random design to ensure every portion of each trail was studied throughout the study period (Fig. 1).Each 1500 m trail segment was divided into six zones, each of which contained one camera. Each zone was divided into six subsections, and every week one subsection was randomly selected in each zone for the camera to be deployed for seven days. At the end of a seven-day deployment period, each camera was moved to a new, randomly selected subsection within its original zone for the next deployment. Each subsection was used only once during the entire study period.We used digital camera traps (Browning Strike Force ModelBTC-5HDPX, Prometheus Group, LLC, Birmingham, Alabama, USA)to record human and wildlife activity on the trails in the study area. The motion-triggered cameras captured still images when a human, animal, or vehiclemoved in front of them, with a delay of one second between photos.The cameras also recorded the date and time that each photo was taken, and this information was later used to create species detection histories. For each deployment we recorded the height of the tallest vegetation between the camera and the trail in its view to account for the potential for tall vegetation to obscure small animals from the camera’s view.Cameras were considered non-operational if the batteries died, the SD card became too full to store any additionalphotos, or the camera fell and was no longer facing the trail. We also discarded the camera-days where cattle were present as the impacts of cattle ranching on wildlife was beyond the scope of this study.The short delay of one second between photos allowed for the collection of detailed photo sequences, often with multiple photos representing a single visit. We processed the resulting image dataset by saving one image to represent each “capture,” or one individual person,animal, or vehicleat one time. Acapture starts when an individual enters the camera’s view, and it ends when that individual leaves the camera’s view and is absent from the next photo. Each sequence of photos was examined to determine the number of captures in the sequence. The number of captures of each species denotesthe number of times the cameras were triggered by activity.This method countsindividualseach separate time they pass in front of the camera, which represents the amount of activity at the site rather than the number ofunique individuals.All wildlife sightingswere identified to species using all available clueswithin the photo sequences, including body size, body features, color patterns, and fur textures.Four wildlife species were sufficiently common to createoccupancy models: mule deer(Odocoileus hemionus), coyotes(Canis latrans), red foxes(Vulpes vulpes), and black bears(Ursus americanus). The metadata of the scored photos wasused tocreate presence-absence detection histories for each of the four focal speciesin the Rprogramming language v4.1.0(R Core Team 2021) usingthe package camtrapR (Niedballaet al. 2016).The detection histories were then used to run single-species, single-season occupancy models for each of the four focal species(Mackenzie et al. 2006). We fittedoccupancy models in the R package unmarked(Fiske and Chandler 2011).The primary period, or “season,”(Mackenzie et al. 2006)for the occupancy framework was seven days long as each camera was deployed for seven days before being movedto start a new deployment. The secondary period, or “survey,” (Mackenzie et al. 2006) was one day, meaning thepresence or absence of a species or activity was measured on a daily basis.Detectability is represented on a daily scale and occupancy is represented on a seasonal scale.We calculated the number of captures of each human activity per day and used these daily captures as predictor variables in the detection formulas of the models. We replaced missing values with deployment mean valueswherever predictor variables were missing values due to camera operability problems. We then calculated the seven-day averages ofdaily captures of each activity at each site to use as seasonal predictor variablesin the occupancy formulas of the models. We standardized all continuous predictor variables, which included survey-level covariates: pedestrians(ped), bikers(biker), and motorized vehicles(vehicle);seasonalcovariates: site-averaged pedestrians (avg.ped), site-averaged bikers (avg.biker), and site-averaged motorized vehicles (avg.vehicle);as well as distance from the trailhead(scale.distance), understory vegetation height(scale.veg), and Julian day of the start of each deployment (start.jday.scale). We tested for multicollinearity among the human predictor variables and found that pedestrians and dogs were highly correlated (r > 0.9). Therefore we excludeddog datafrom the models. There were very few horseback riders in the data set, and since we did not expect themto be a major driver of habitat usepatterns in this system, we excluded equestrian datatoavoid over-fittingthe models. We included human activities as covariates in both the detectabilityformulas and the occupancy formulasin accordance with our hypotheses. The occupancy formula testswhether the covariate has an effect on the presence or absence of the species. The detectability formula tests whether a covariate causes the species to be easier or harder to detect. We includedhuman covariates inthe detectability formula to testwhether the focal species weremore visible or secretive at higher levels of human activity. We used daily count data for the detectability covariates and seasonal averages of the count data for the occupancy covariates. We hypothesizedthat trailheads have more human activity than farther along the trails, and we expected that proximity to the trailhead could affect species occupancy. Therefore we included a variable accounting for the distance from the trailhead in the occupancy formula.We expected that focal species’ predators or prey could affect occupancy. We therefore included predators (coyotes, black bears, and mountain lions) in the deer model (avg.pred) and prey in the coyote, fox, and bear models. For bears and coyotes, the “avg.prey” variable included all detections of deer, elk, marmots, and hares combined. For foxes, the “avg.prey.fox” variable included only marmots and hares.We recognize that both coyotes and foxes eat smaller mammals as well as birds at our study site.We included the understoryvegetation height variable in the detectability formula for its potential todecrease probability of detection, especially for smaller animals. We also included the Julian day variable, which represents the first Julian day of each deployment, because animals may change their activity patterns throughout the year.We included trail as a random effect in the occupancy formula to account for potential differences among the five trails studied.We included this random effect in every model we tested. We tested random effects in the occupancy models using the R package TMB (Kristensen et al. 2016). We used the following full modelfor the model selection process:p ~ ped + biker + vehicle + scale.veg + start.jday.scaleΨ ~ avg.ped + avg.biker + avg.vehicle + scale.distance + [avg.pred or avg.prey or avg.prey.fox] + (1 | Trail)We used a two-step model selection approach(Mackenzie et al. 2006):we first tested all possible combinations of covariates in the detectability formulausing full occupancy formulas andfound the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Then we used the lowest AIC detectability formula to test all combinations of covariates in the occupancy formula. This approach involved testing a total of 64 models for each species(listed in supplementary materials). The lowest AIC model resulting from the second step was considered the “best” model for a given species. For the black bear models, seven models in step two did not converge. We provided these models with starting values,and one of them converged while the other six still did not converge. We discarded the six models that did not converge afterbeing given starting values. Site occupancy of unmarked species can be estimated with an occupancy model framework, but the model assumptions are often violated in camera trap studies(Mackenzie et al. 2006). In this study, the model assumption that sites are “closed” (site occupancy does not change during the survey period) is violated because the home ranges of the species in this study are likely larger than the distance between the cameras. Therefore, the model output isinterpreted as habitat use, the probability that a site is used by a species, rather than the probability of occupancy (Mackenzie et al. 2006; Burton et al. 2015; Gould et al. 2019). All cameras were deployed along trails; therefore the resulting models can be used to make inferences about habitat use and detectability around these trails."

Separate tests were conducted with the geometry shown in theright  of  Figure  4.3  with  a  3.25  mm  gap  to  qualitatively  examine  attempts  at  multi-pointignition.For each experiment, the chamber was evacuated and then filled with methane and airmixed at an equivalence ratio (φ) of 0.7±0.03 to an initial pressurePinitof 200±0.5 kPa.φwas measured using species partial pressures in a separate premixed tank to ensure con-sistent fuel concentration and mixing.  This value ofφwas chosen because reliable ignition could be obtained using both ignition techniques in this fuel-air mixture, facilitating theircomparison.  The initial temperature in the chamber was measured as 300±5 K with a K-type thermocouple.  This corresponds to a number density of approximatelyn= 80 mol/m3,which falls just inside the range of number densities in some of the preheated E85 engineexperiments by Sj ̈oberg et al. (2014).  Non-thermal plasma chemistry is a strong functionof  the  reduced  electric  field,E/n(Fridman,  2008a),  and  so  the  behavior  of  the  dischargeat engine-relevant densities is expected to be similar to the behavior during engine opera-tion, even though the subsequent flame kernel development will be different.  The pressureinside the chamber during ignition and flame development was measured at 100 kHz usinga piezoelectric pressure transducer (6052B Kistler) and the signals were amplified using adual-mode  charge  amplifier  (5010B  Kistler).   Schlieren  imaging  was  performed  at  50  kHzusing high-speed camera (Photron FASTCAM SA4), recording the development of the flamekernel during the first few milliseconds after ignition through the quartz windows.  The sizeof  the  premixed  tank  restricted  the  total  number  of  experiments;  at  least  nine  runs  percondition were possible.For the PND experiments, the voltage and current across the electrodes during the firstpulse  were  measured  with  an  inline  high-voltage  attenuator  and  current  probe  (TransientPlasma Systems, Inc.)  and recorded with a digital oscilloscope at 2.5 GHz (Tektronix TDS3024B). The first pulse in every experiment was highly consistent, though recent pressure-rise calorimetry work by Wolk and Ekoto (2017) has shown that subsequent pulses are notnecessarily the same as the first, which will be discussed later.Experimental data analysisThe net heat release rates (HRR) of the ignition experiments are calculated based on thein-chamber pressure history using Equation 4.1, whereVis the chamber volume andγis theratio of specific heats (Heywood, 1988). This is the same as Equation 3.1 in Chapter 3, exceptVis constant, and so alldVterms are zero.  Heat losses through the chamber walls are notconsidered and so these calculations are for comparison only.γis determined by weightingthe average of the specific heats in the burned (γb) and unburned (γu) states according toEquation  4.2,  in  whichβis  a  progress  variable  defined  by  Equation  4.3.γbandγuarecalculated from 1-D adiabatic free flame simulations inCantera(Goodwin et al., 2014)using  mixture-averaged  transport  properties  and  the  GRI-MECH  3.0  mechanism  (Smithet al., 1999).Equation 4.1 is integrated over time in Equation 4.4 to obtain the cumulative net heat releaseas a function of time,Qnet(t), as well as the total net heat released,Qnet,tot.Qnet,totis usedto  calculate  theflame  development  time,τd,  andflame  rise  time,τr.   In  this  study,τdisdefined as the time between ignition and when the first 10% ofQnet,tothas been achieved.Similarly,τris defined as the time between when the first 10% and the first 90% ofQnet,tothasbeen achieved.  These measurements are conceptually similar to those of CA10 and CA90 inChapter 3, and a conceptual diagram of these timescales with respect toQnet(t) is shown inFigure 4.4.  They are typically comparable with one another (Heywood, 1988) and allow usto compare the influence of the PND system at both early and late stages of the combustionprocess.  The sum ofτdandτris referred to as theoverall burning time,τo, and this is usedto compare overall combustion time.For  each  experiment,  the  flame  sizeLfis  calculated  based  on  the  high-speed  imagingdata using an edge-detection algorithm inMatlabto track the greatest extent of the flamekernel after subtracting the first frame from every frame of the footage.  This measurementis then numerically differentiated with respect to time to calculate burned flame speedsb.Unburned flame speedsuis calculated by multiplyingsbby the adiabatic density ratio ofthe burned and unburned mixture,ρb/ρu, as in Equation 4.5. Like the values ofγbandγu,ρb/ρuis obtained from the aforementionedCantera(Goodwinet al., 2014) simulations.  The simulation is also used to calculate a reference unburned flamespeed,su,ref, with which to compare the experimental unburned flame speeds obtained fromEquation 4.5.  This method of calculatingsuis acceptable because the thermal and massdiffusivities  of  methane/air  flames  are  approximately  equal,  and  so  flame  stretch  effects are negligible for most of the flame kernel evolution (Law, 2006).  This calculation is usedprimarily as a method of comparison among the different ignition conditions, and secondarilyto confirm that the measuredφ,Pinit, andTuare reasonably accurate.  If they are accurate,then the calculatedsuof the flames will approachsu,refas the flame leaves the region ofthe electrodes.  The experimental uncertainties ∆φ= 0.03, ∆Pinit= 0.5 kPa, and ∆Tu=5 K are propagated to calculate deviations insu,ref,  and these uncertainties are added inquadrature (Coleman and Steele, 2009) as in Equation 4.6.The reference unburned flame speed is calculated assu,ref= 13.9±2.0 cm/s.For tests with the disk electrode,  the total schlieren image intensity is calculated as afunction of time.  The first frame is subtracted from every frame of footage, and so only thetotal intensity of the resulting differences is calculated.  The intensity serves as a measure of“schlieren activity,” indicating thermal events associated with the pulsed discharges, and isparticularly useful for detecting events otherwise unobservable to the human eye."

            "output": "While increasing the number of pulses generally reduces flame development time, the reduction-per-pulse relative to SI ignition reduces with each additional pulse, indicating that the bene-fits associated with additional pulses decreases as the flame kernel develops.  As the numberof pulses increases, the peak pressure increases and the peak pressure occurs earlier.  Thishelps explains some of the efficiency gains observed in previous engine experiments (Sj ̈oberget al., 2014; Sevik et al., 2016).Hydrodynamic effectsThe high-speed images in Figure 4.7 show that there is a significant non-chemical componentto the combustion enhancement.  The flame kernel is driven away from the electrodes, re-ducing heat losses to the electrodes from the developing flame.  While this helps explain thereducedτdin the pulsed cases, increased flame kernel expulsion alone does not completelyexplain the decreases inτdbetween the inductive spark cases and the pulsed discharge cases(a decrease of 10±1.8 ms), since the flame kernel from the inductive spark discharge is ini-tially the same size or larger than the flame kernels from the 2-pulse and 5-pulse discharges,as shown in Figure 4.8.  The high-speed images in Figure 4.7 show increased flame wrinkling,a phenomenon which increases the surface area of the flame in contact with the unburnedmixture  and  enhances  the  overall  burning  rate.   This  enhancement  effect  persists  beyondthe initial flame development, which is whyτralso slightly decreases in the pulsed dischargecases.The causes for the instabilities which increase flame wrinkling are likely rooted in localpressure changes caused by the repetitive discharges.  TheLfdata in the inset of Figure 4.8show that the continued discharges are the primary factor in the divergence of the differentPND ignition modes—for the first 10 pulses of the 20-pulse case, the averageLfis similar tothat of the 10-pulse case, and so on.  Reactive flow experiments by Lefkowitz and Ombrello(2017b)  have  shown  evidence  of  pulse-to-pulse  coupling,  in  which  a  moving  flame  kernelignited by a nanosecond pulsed discharge is influenced by subsequent pulses.  Although thegases  in  this  experiment  are  initially  quiescent,  the  pulses  could  induce  some  bulk  fluidmotion.  3-D Direct Numerical Simulation modeling by Castela et al. (2016) and associatedexperimental work by Lovascio et al. (2017) with pin-to-pin electrode geometries have shownas  such.   The  aforementioned  pressure-rise  calorimetry  experiments  by  Wolk  and  Ekoto (2017) indicate that transient arc breakdown is more likely as the number of pulses increase,and that these discharges cause more rapid local gas heating than low temperature plasma(LTP) discharges.  As additional pulses are driven between the electrodes, the lower numberdensity increases the local reduced electric field, so that the successive pulses are “thermallypreconditioned”  into  transitioning  to  arc.   In  our  study,  the  pressure  gradients  associatedwith this phenomenon interact with the electrode shape to drive the hot gases away fromthe cold metal surfaces, simultaneously reducing heat losses and increasing wrinkling of theflame kernel surface.Chemical effectsThe  effect  of  chemistry  on  combustion  enhancement  is  more  difficult  to  discern  from  thepresented measurements, and thus only limited conclusions can be drawn from the results.The high-speed schlieren images of the disk electrode in Figure 4.9 definitely show a decreasein local fluid density—indicating a rise in local fluid temperature, a reduction in number ofmolecules, or both.  Visible-light photographs of the streamers for this electrode are shownin  Figure  4.10.   A  comparison  between  Figure  4.9  and  Figure  4.10  is  highly  suggestive  ofa  link  between  the  observed  density  gradients  and  the  streamers.   A  plot  of  the  schlierenactivity for the experiment shown in Figure 4.9 is shown in Figure 4.11.  It can be seen thateach  PND  event  is  associated  with  a  rise  in  schlieren  activity,  indicating  changes  in  localdensity gradients in the image.  Though the reasons for this cannot be confirmed withouthigh-resolution species measurements in time, a survey of the plasma literature suggests thatthe likely culprit for these gradients is an increase in the local gas temperature caused by fast gas heating processes associated with LTP discharges.  These processes include electron-ionrecombination, quenching of electronically-excited N2and O (Stancu et al., 2010; Bak et al.,2011;  Lo  et  al.,  2014a),  radical  recombination  (Pendleton  et  al.,  2013),  and  relaxation  ofvibrationally excited O2and N2(Ono et al., 2010; Lo et al., 2014b).  In air at atmosphericpressure, these processes occur on timescales spanning∼10 ns to∼100μs, and so differentprocesses may influence the results seen in Figure 4.11 at different times.More conclusively, the fact that ignition was not possible using a single pulsed discharge inany of the experiments suggests that although reactive species are generated, not enough areproduced, and/or the local gas temperature is not high enough (>∼700 K) to sustain chain-branching reactions (Law, 2006).  The decrease in schlieren activity following each pulse inFigure 4.11 is likely due to the diffusion of the density gradient into the surrounding mixture,but subsequent pulses drive the temperature and/or radical increases required for successfulignition.   The  gas  is  ‘primed’  for  the  next  pulse:  since  the  number  density  is  lower,  thereduced electric field of the next pulse is higher, approaching the threshold to arc transition,as was observed in the engine experiments using the same electrode geometry (Sj ̈oberg et al.,2014)."
