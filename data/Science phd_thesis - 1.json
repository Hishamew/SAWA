            "output": "Precise tuning of the expression of each gene in the genome is critical for many aspects of cell function. The level of gene expression is regulated at multiple distinct steps, including transcription, mRNA degradation and translation(Schwanhäusser et al., 2011). Regulation of all of these steps in gene expression is important, though the relative contribution of each control mechanism varies for different biological processes (Brar et al., 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2015; Peshkin et al., 2015; Tanenbaum et al., 2015; Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007).Measuring  the  translation  rate  from  individual  mRNAs  over  time  provides  valuable information on the mechanisms of translation and translational regulation. In vitroexperiments, mainly using bacterial ribosomes, have revealed exquisite information on ribosome translocation dynamics at the single molecule level (Blanchard, 2009; Chen et al., 2012; Cornish et al., 2008; Fei et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2008; Zaher and Green, 2009), but such methods have not yet been applied in vivo. In contrast, a genome-wide snapshot of the translational efficiency of endogenous mRNAs in vivocan be obtained through the method of ribosomal profiling (Ingolia et al., 2009, 2011). However, this method requires averaging of many cells and provides limited temporal information because of the requirement to lyse cells to make these measurements. Single cell imaging studies have succeeded in measuring average protein synthesis rates (Aakalu et al., 2001; Brittis et al., 2002; Han et al., 2014; Leung et al., 2006; Tanenbaum et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2006), observing the first translation event of an mRNA (Halstead et al., 2015), localizing sub-cellular sites of translation by co-localizing mRNAs and ribosomes (Katz et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2015), and staining nascent polypeptides with small molecule dyes (Rodriguez et al., 2006).While ribosomal profiling and other recently developed methods have provided many important new insights into the regulation of translation, many questions cannot be addressed using current technologies. For example, it is unclear to what extent different mRNA molecules produced in a single cell from the same gene behave similarly. Many methods to study translation in  vivorequire averaging of many mRNAs, masking potential differences between individual 5mRNA molecules. Such differences could arise from differential post-transcriptional regulation, such as nucleotide modifications (Choi et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015), differential transcript lengths through use of alternative transcriptional start sites (Rojas-Duran and Gilbert, 2012)or polyadenylationsite selection (Elkon et al., 2013; Gupta et al., 2014), differences in ribonucleic protein (RNP) composition (Wu et al., 2015), distinct intracellular localization (Hüttelmaier et al., 2005), or different states of RNA secondary structure (Babendure et al., 2006; Kertesz et al., 2010). Heterogeneity among mRNA molecules could have a profound impact on the total amount of polypeptide produced, as well as the localization of protein synthesis, but remains poorly studied. Furthermore, the extent to which translation on single mRNA molecules varies over time also is largely unknown. For example, translation may occur in bursts, rather than continuously (Tatavarty  et  al.,  2012;  Yu  et  al.,  2006),  and  regulation  of  protein  synthesis  may  occur  by modulating burst size and/or frequency, which could occur either globally or on each mRNA molecule individually. In addition, the ability of an mRNA molecule to initiate translation may vary with time or spatial location, for example as cells progress through thecell cycle (Stumpf et al., 2013; Tanenbaum et al., 2015)or undergo active microtubule-based transport to particular cellular destinations (Holt and Schuman, 2013). Such regulation could involve changes in the rates of translation initiation and/or the ribosome elongation. To address these questions, new methods are required for visualizing translation on single mRNA molecules in live cells over time.Here, we present a new method, based on the SunTag fluorescence tagging system that we recently developed (Tanenbaum et al., 2014), for measuring the translation of single mRNA molecules over long periods of time. Using this system, we have measured initiation, elongation and  stalling  on  individual  mRNA  molecules  and  have  uncovered  unexpected  heterogeneity among different mRNAs molecules encoded by the same gene within a single cell. Our system will be widely applicable to the study of mRNA translation in live cells."

Plasmid transfections were performed with Fugene 6 (Roche), and stable transformants were selected with zeocin (Life Technologies). Unless noted otherwise, reporter transcripts were expressed froma doxycycline-inducible promoter,and expression of the reporter was induced with 1 mg/mL doxycycline (Sigma)for 1 hr before imaging. Harringtonine (Cayman Chemical) was used at3 mg/ml. 5 mM 4NQO (Sigma) was added to cells for 1 hr before imaging.Puromycin (Life Technologies) was used at 100 mg/ml. Hippuristanol (a kindgift of Dr. J. Tanaka) was used at 5 mM. Cycloheximide (Sigma) was used at200 mg/ml.MicroscopyCells  were  grown  in  96-well  glass  bottom  dishes  (Matriplate,  Brooks).  Images  were acquired using a Yokogawa CSU-X1 spinning disk confocal attached to an inverted Nikon TI microscope with Nikon Perfect Focus system, 1003 NA 1.49 objective, an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EM-CCD camera, and Micro-Manager software (Edelstein et al., 2010). Single z-plane images were acquired every 30 s unless noted otherwise. During image acquisition, cells were maintainedat a constant temperature of 36°C–37°C. Camera exposure times were generally set to 500 ms, unless noted otherwise. We note that stable expression of PP7-mCherry, either with or without the  CAAX  domain,  also  resulted  in  an  accumulation  of  mCherry  signal  in  lysosomes,  but lysosomes could be readily distinguished from mRNA foci based on signal intensityand mobility.FACSGFP and scFv-GFP (Fig. 2.1b), mCherry, PP7-mCherry, or PP7-2xmCherry-CAAX (Fig. 2.1f) were expressed from a constitutive promoter, while the two reporters, SunTag24x-mCherry and GFP-PP724x(Fig. 2.1b and f, respectively) were expressed from an inducible promoter in U2OS cells expressing the Tet repressor protein, and their expression was induced 24 hr after transfection using doxycycline (1 mg/ml). This ensured that the reporters were translated in the presence  of  high  levels  of  the  scFv-GFP  and  PP7-2xmCherry-CAAX  proteins.  Cells  were collected one day after doxycycline induction and analyzed by FACS. Cells were gated for GFP and mCherry double positivity, and the mCherry and GFP levels (Fig. 2.1b and f, respectively) were analyzed using Flowjo v10.1.General  considerations  for  quantifying  translation  based  on  scFv-GFP  fluorescence  intensity valuesIn  this  study,  we  provide  estimates  for  the  number  of  ribosomes  per  mRNA,  reveal ribosome initiation and translocation rates and provide measurements of ribosome stalling. All these values were calculated based on fluorescence intensities of the scFv-GFP antibody bound to nascent polypeptides. It is important to note that such fluorescence intensities by themselves do not provide quantitative information, but only can be interpreted after taking several factors into consideration. 1) Ribosome position along the mRNA. Ribosome position along the mRNA affects the number of SunTag peptides that have been  synthesized, and  thus  the  amount  of  scFv-GFP  fluorescence  associated  with  that ribosome/nascent polypeptide. We have generated a mathematical model to correct for this effect (see the section “Modeling of the fluorescence intensity of translation sites” below, and Fig.S2.7).It is important to note that this model assumes a homogeneous distribution of ribosomes along the mRNA which is likely accurate when averaging many mRNAs, but stochastic distributions can occur on an individual mRNA molecule. Also, non-homogenous distribution of ribosomes will not bias the estimate of ribosome number in ensemble statistics, as it is equally likely to underestimate or to overestimate ribosome number.2) Variability in the number of scFv-GFPs bound to a SunTag peptide array. The fluorescence intensity of a nascent polypeptide depends on the number of scFv-GFP molecules  bound.  The  number  of  scFv-GFP  antibody  molecules  bound  to  a  single  SunTag polypeptide can, however, vary. This variation may be limited though, as binding of the scFv-GFP to the 24 peptide SunTag array appears to saturate when sufficient cytoplasmic scFv-GFP is present, resulting in the binding of close to 24 scFv-GFPs per SunTag24xarray(Tanenbaum et al., 2014). Variation in the number of scFv-GFPs per SunTag24xarray will not affect the calculation of the number of ribosomes per mRNA, as this variation will occur on both the nascent polypeptides and  the  fully  synthesized  and  released  SunTag  protein  in  the  same  cells  which  is  used  to normalize the fluorescence intensity of the translation sites. However, when a lot of SunTag24xmolecules have been synthesized and released into the cytoplasm, they can sequester the free scFv-GFP, leaving insufficient free scFv-GFP to bind all newly synthesized nascent SunTag peptides. Indeed, we have observed that at high expression levels of the reporter, translation sites become progressively dimmer after several hours, indicative of cytoplasmic depletion of the scFv-GFP. While such depletion of cytoplasmic scFv results both in dimmer translation sites and dimmer fully synthesized SunTag protein (used for normalization), and therefore does not affect our calculations of ribosome number per mRNA. Nonetheless, to circumvent this issue, we have used an inducible promoter to initiate reporter expression only ~1 hr before image acquisition. An additional source of variability in scFv-GFP binding to the SunTag peptides is introduced by the lag time that exists between synthesis of a new SunTag peptide and binding to the scFv-GFP. However,our experiments show that this lag time likely does not substantially decrease overall fluorescence intensity of the translation site, indicating that the binding reaction is relatively fast. This lag time likely depends on the level of free cytoplasmic scFv-GFP, and could therefore vary under different conditions.3) Fluorescence decay of the scFv-GFP signal at translation sites.In several experiments, including cases of natural translation shutdown and harringtonine ribosome run-off experiments, we observed a reduction in scFv-GFP fluorescence intensity at translation  sites.  We  generally  interpret  this  fluorescence  decay  as  ribosomes  terminating translation at the stop codon, which results in nascent chain release and ribosome recycling. While this conclusion is likely valid in most cases, alternative explanations are possible. For example, ribosomes stall for extended periods of time on mRNAs with chemical damage or on the Xbp1 nucleotide pausing sequence, but eventually scFv-GFP signal associated with stalled translation sites does decrease. While it is possible that ribosomes eventually normally read through such stall sequences and terminate normally at a stop codon, it is also possible that ribosomes are removed from mRNAs after a prolonged stalling event. Additional experiments are required to distinguish these events, for example by placing the stall-inducing sequence upstream of the SunTag peptide array.4) PhotobleachingPhotobleaching rates were determined by measuring the total GFP signal of the entire cell over time. In experiments where photobleaching resulted in a fluorescence decrease of >10% of the initial fluorescence intensity, fluorescence intensities of translation sites were corrected for photobleaching.Calculation of Ribosome ElongationRibosome elongation rates were determined by three different methods.1) Population measurements from harringtonine ribosome run-off (Related to Fig.2.2)The linear phase of the decrease in GFP fluorescence after new ribosome translation is prevented by addition of harringtonine provides information on the rate of ribosome movement along the mRNA. A model for the fluorescence signal is provided below(See Modeling of the fluorescence intensity of translation sites)along with details of how the data was fit to determine the elongation rate.  2) Calculating the ribosome elongation rate based on single mRNA run-off times (Related to Fig. S2.2e)The total time required for run-off of all ribosomes from individual mRNAs represents the time untilthe last (i.e.most 5’) ribosome completes translation after harringtonine treatment. Individual  translation  site  intensities  were  quantified  using  the  spot_counter  ImageJ  plugin (http://fiji.sc/SpotCounter) developed by Nico Stuurman, which draws a box around the selected translation site and scores the number of time-points that the translation site was detected. Automatic tracking was manually curated for all spots to ensure high quality tracking data. The average run-off time for all mRNAs was then determined, and we subtracted 60 s from this time, the time required for harringtonine to enter the cell (Ingolia et al., 2011). We then divided the reporter length (1462 codons for the SunTag24x-Kif18b-PP724x reporter) by the corrected run-off time to obtain the ribosome elongation rate. This rate assumes that the final ribosome loaded near the 5’ end of the mRNA, which may not be true for all mRNAs. This assumption may slightly overestimate ribosome elongation rates, as the actual distance covered by the most 5’ ribosome covers until completion of translation will be slightly less than 1462 codons, if it is downstream of the start codon at the time of harringtonine addition. However, considering that most mRNAs have ~20 ribosomes and the average inter-ribosomal distance is therefore ~70 codons, the most 5’ ribosome will usually be within 70 codons of the start site, which represents a 5% error.3) Determining the ribosome elongation rate from single ribosome tracking data (Related to Fig. 2.7)By limiting translation initiation using the Emi1 5’UTR_long fused to the translation reporter, individual ribosomes could be observed decoding an mRNA molecule. For each single ribosome translation event, we measured the duration of the event, by determining the first time-point that GFP could reliably be detected over the background until the GFP signal disappeared. Only tracks were included that lasted less than 12 min. However, determining ribosome elongation rate based on such measurements was non-trivial, as this requires knowledge of the precise position of the ribosome along the transcript when the nascent chain signal is first detected; presumably a number  of  SunTag  peptides  need  to  have  been  synthesized  before  sufficient  signal  has accumulated  to  allow  detection.  We  therefore  needed  to  identify  the  fluorescence  intensity detection  limit.  To  accomplish  this,  we  first  determined  the  maximal  fluorescence  intensity associated with a single ribosome; this occurs when the entire SunTag peptide array has been synthesized (Fig.2.7c). Maximal intensity was calculated by aligning all of the traces (n = 44) at the last time point in which fluorescence was observed and averaging the fluorescence intensity of the last 3 time points before polypeptide dissociation. We then aligned all 44 traces at the first point we could visually detect fluorescence and found that we could reliably detect signal from single ribosomes when their nascent chain-associated fluorescence was ~1/3 of the maximal intensity (Fig.2.7b). From this, we infer that ~8 of the 24 SunTag peptides likely have been synthesized at this point in time, which places these ribosomes on codon 245 (taking into account that SunTag peptides will not be labeled when inside the ribosome exit tunnel). Therefore, from the time of first fluorescence measurement to the release of the completed polypeptide on the stop codon (406 s on average for n = 44 individual ribosome translocations), the ribosome moves 1462-245  =  1217  codons  (since  the  whole  transcript  is  1462codons  long).  The  ribosome elongation rate can be calculated as the number of codons / time: 1217/406 = 3.0 codons/s.Translation Initiation Rate1) Estimation of steady state initiation rateTo maintain a constant ribosome occupancy, the rate of removal of ribosomes from the mRNA molecule after completion of translation, must be balanced by new ribosome loading on the  mRNA  through  translation  initiation.  To  estimate  the  translation  initiation rate,  we  first calculated the average inter-ribosomal distance, which is 58-146 codons assuming a ribosome number  per  mRNA  of  10-25  ribosomes  on  the  SunTag24x-Kif18b  reporter.  Considering  the ribosome elongation rate of 3.5 codons/s (for the Kif18b reporter), a ribosome will complete translation on average every 58/3.5 to 146/3.5 = 17 to 42 s. Thus, if constant ribosome occupancy is maintained, the initiation rate must be between 1/17 s-1to 1/42 s-1or 1.4 to 3.6 min-1. These values represent average initiation rates, as the initiation rate on single mRNA molecules will vary over time. 2) Comparing the translation initiation rate on newly transcribed versus polysomal mRNAsThrough  the  experiments  in  which  single  translating  ribosomes  were  tracked,  we determined that ribosomes could be first detected when ~1/3 of SunTag peptides had been synthesized (when the ribosome is positioned around codon 245 (see above)). Thus, when the first, pioneer ribosome was detected on a newly transcribed mRNA molecule, itwas likely near this position. After initial fluorescence detection of the pioneer ribosome, translation site signal increased continuously for several min (Fig. 2.4b). This fluorescence increase was presumably both due to the increase in the number of synthesized SunTag peptides on the pioneer ribosome, as well as due to additional ribosomes that initiated after the pioneer ribosome. The translation site fluorescence intensity reached a steady state ~6 min after the initial detection of fluorescence (Fig.2.4b), indicating that the ribosome density remained constant from that point on. At a translocation rate of 3-3.5 codons/s, it would take the pioneer ribosome ~6 min to reach the stop codon from the position of initial detection (codon 245). From these calculations, we conclude that the ribosome density on the mRNA has already reached its maximal value as soon as the pioneer ribosome completes translation. Since ribosome density is a function of ribosome initiation rate and elongation rate, we infer that the initiation rate on the newly transcribed mRNA must be identical to that on mRNAs with established polysomes, assuming that the elongation rates are on average similar.Estimation of Ribosome Number per mRNATo obtain the number of ribosomes per mRNA molecule, we set up a normalization experiment to compare the average intensity of the single translation sites with the intensity coming  from  single,  fully  synthesized  SunTag24x-Kif18b  proteins  (Fig.S2.2a).  As  the  fully synthesized SunTag-Kif18b proteins encompass 24 copies of the SunTag peptide, their intensity should be comparable with the fluorescence intensity associated with a ribosome at the 3’ end on the mRNA.  However, the ribosomes at the 5’ end of the mRNA will be much dimmer because they have not fully synthesized the SunTag epitopes. Thus, dividing the translation site intensity by the intensity from a single fully synthesized SunTag-Kif18b protein will underestimate the actual number of ribosomes on an mRNA. A correction factor derived from our model presented below was used to obtain a more accurate estimate of ribosome number.Modeling of the fluorescence intensity of translation sites Every active translation site is composed of one single mRNA with multiple ribosomes undergoing translation. The SunTag peptides produced from ribosomes are bound by scFv-GFP antibodies floating in the cytoplasm, giving rise to a fluorescence signal from the translation complex. Ribosomes on the 5’ end of the mRNA are still translating part of the SunTag peptide, thus  resulting  in  a  partial  fluorescence  signal  from  the  emerging  polypeptide  chain,  while ribosomes that are translocating on the 3’ end of the gene have already synthesized the entire SunTag peptide array and are fully covered by the antibodies. Therefore, to interpret intensity changes from a transcript loaded with multiple ribosomes, we have generated a model that takes into account ribosome location as well as density on the mRNA as a function of time. The intensity from a single ribosome will increase gradually as the ribosome moves towards the 3’ end until it reaches a plateau where all SunTag peptides are synthesized (Fig. S2.7a).

            "output": "Using the SunTag system, we have developed an imaging method that measures the translation of individual mRNAs in living cells. Immobilization of mRNAs on the plasma membrane allows the long-term (>1 hr) observation of translation of single mRNA molecules, which enables analyses of translational initiation, elongation, and stalling in live cells for the first time. Under conditions of infrequent translational initiation, we can even observe a single ribosome decoding an entire mRNA molecule. Our observations reveal considerable and unexpected heterogeneity in the translation properties of different mRNA molecules derived from the same gene in a single cell, with some not translating, others actively translating with many ribosomes, and others bound to  stalled  ribosomes.  TheSunTag  translation  imagingassay  should  be  applicable  to  many different cell types,including neurons and embryos, in which the localization and control of protein translation is thought to play an importantrole in cell function. Comparison of methods to study translation in vivo Ribosome profiling, a method in which fragments of mRNAs that are protected by the ribosome are analyzed by deep sequencing (Ingolia et al., 2009), has found widespread use in measuring translation. The strength of ribosomal profiling lies in its abilityto measure translation on a genome-wide scale of endogenous mRNAs. However, a limitation of ribosome profiling is the need to pool mRNAs from many thousands of cells for a single measurement. Thus, ribosome profiling in its present form cannot be used to study translation heterogeneity between different cells in a population or among different mRNA molecules in the same cell. Furthermore, since ribosome profiling requires cell lysis, only a single measurement can be made for each sample, limiting studies of temporal changes. A number of single-cell translation reporters have been developed based on fluorescent proteins (Aakalu et al., 2001; Brittis et al., 2002; Han et al., 2014; Raab-Graham et al., 2006; Tanenbaum et al., 2015; Tatavarty et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2006). Such reporters generally rely on the accumulation of new fluorescence after the assay is initiated. Advantages of these systems are that they are generally easy to use and have single-cell sensitivity. However, they do not provide single mRNA resolution, often do not allow continuous measurement of translation, and do not report on ribosome initiation and elongation rates. Finally, two methods were developed recently to imagetranslation on single mRNAs in vivo. In one approach, the firstround of translation is visualized(Halstead et al., 2015). Thismethod, however, does not allow continuous measurementsof translation. The second approach involves measurementsof the number of ribosomes bound to an mRNA using fluorescencefluctuation spectroscopy (Wu et al., 2015). The advantage of this method is that it can detect binding of a single fluorescent protein to an mRNA and different subcellular sites can be probed to study spatial differences in translation. The limitation of this method though is the inability to follow translation of single mRNAs over time, as these mRNAs cannot be trackedin the cell. SunTag-based translation imaging assays are unique thus far in their ability to follow translation of individual mRNAs over time.This translation assay can be employed with either freely diffusing or tethered mRNAs, the choice of which will depend on the biological question to be addressed. In the study by Wang et al. (2016) (Wang et al., 2016), translation is observed in distinct  spatial  compartments  in  neurons  using  a  similar  SunTag-based  translation  imaging method with non-tethered mRNAs. In contrast, for studying ribosome translocation dynamics, the tethering  assay  provides  the  ability  to  track  a  single  mRNA  throughout the  duration  of  the ribosome elongation cycle. Using this assay, we could measure polysome buildup rates overtime, observe mRNAs cycling between translating and non-translating states, uncoverheterogeneity in translation initiation rates (e.g., with the Emi1 5’UTR) and even observe a single ribosome translating an entire transcript. These measurements were aided by the vastly improved signal-to-noise of the tethered assay and the ability to easily track slowly diffusing tethered mRNAs for an hour or more. These long-term observations allowed us to discover that mRNAs can reversibly switch between a translating and non-translating state and have a high variability in pause duration at the Xbp1 site. Thus, the untethered and tethered SunTag assays provide means to study translation of single mRNA molecules, which will be applicable to a wide variety of biological questions and will be complementary to existing methods of studying translation. A drawback of our assay is the need to insert an array of SunTag peptide repeats into the mRNA of interest to fluorescently label the nascent polypeptide and the need to insert an array of PP7 binding sites in the 3’UTR to label the mRNA. As is true of any tagging strategy, these modifications could interfere with translation and/or mRNA stability under certain conditions. We have performed a number of control experiments to ensure that binding the scFv-GFP to the nascent chain and tethering of the transcript to the membrane do not grossly perturb translation (Fig. 2.1band f). We have also shown that ribosome translocation rates and ribosome density are similar when using a reporter with a very short (5x) or long (24x) SunTag peptide array and comparing tethered and non-tethered mRNAs (Fig. 2.2d, S2.2f and S2.4c), indicating that many aspects of translation are not perturbed in our assay. Nevertheless, tethering of certain mRNAs to the plasma membrane may influence translation, especially for those mRNAs that undergo local translation in a specific compartment of the cell. Thus, our assay has unique advantages for certain types of measurements of translation, but appropriate controls should be performed for each experimental system or objective. Heterogeneity in translation of single mRNAs: possible molecular mechanisms Using  our  system,  we  measured  the  ribosome  translocation  speed  on  single  mRNA molecules.  Ribosome  translocation  rates  have  been  measured  in  bulk  previously  in  mouse embryonic stem cells (Ingolia et al., 2011), which yielded a translocation rate of 5.6 codons/s. Our values of 3–5 codons/s (Fig. S2.7) are in general agreement with those published values and very similar to those measured by Wang et al. (2016) (4 codons/s). Our experiments, and those of Wang et al. (2016), are thefirst to measure ribosome translocation rates for a single mRNA species,  in  single  cells  and  on  single  mRNAs,  which  provides  new  opportunities  to  studyregulation of translation elongation. We also found that translation initiation can shut down temporarily on individual mRNAs and rapidly restart (Fig. 2.3). Such shutdown of translation initiation could be due to transient loss of eIF4E binding to the mRNA cap, mRNA decapping followed by recapping (Mukherjee et al., 2012), or transient binding of regulatory proteins. Using our mRNA tethering assay, binding and unbinding of single proteins to translating mRNA could potentially be observed using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), which could open up many additional possibilities for studying translational regulation at the single-molecule level.The pioneer round of translation, the first ribosome to initiate translation on a newly transcribed mRNA, may be especially important, as it is thought to detect defects in the mRNA, including  premature stop  codons (Ishigaki  et  al.,  2001).  A  recently  developed  translation biosensor can detect the location of this pioneer round of translation (Halstead et al., 2015). However, what happens after the first ribosome initiates translation is unknown. Wefound that the translation initiation rate on our reporter mRNA was similar on newly transcribed, recently shut down, andre-initiating mRNAs and polysomal mRNAs (Fig. 2.4), indicating that the initiationrate is independent of the number of ribosomes bound to themRNA. The presence of introns in a gene may also affect translationinitiation on newly transcribed mRNAs (Hir et al., 2016),which could be tested in future studies.A subset of ribosomes stall on mRNAs in a sequence-independentfashion (Fig.  2.2d, S2.2g  and  S2.4a). One possible explanationfor this is that ribosome stalling is caused by naturallyoccurring mRNA ‘‘damage’’ (i.e., chemical modifications of thenucleotides). Previous studies  have  found  that  the 8-oxoguaninemodification  occurs  on  mRNA in  vivo,  and  such modificationscause  ribosome  stalling in  vitro(Simms  et  al.,  2014)and in  vivo(Fig.  2.5c). Alternatively, while we have performed numerouscontrol experiments (Fig. 2.5 and S2.4), we cannot completelyexclude that the observed stalling on a small subset of mRNAsis an artifact of our construct or assay. We also observe ribosomepausing in a sequence-dependent fashion on the pausesite of the Xbp1 transcription factor. Such pausing had beenobserved previously in bulk measurements (Ingolia et al., 2011; Yanagitani et al., 2011), but our quantitative analysis of singlemRNAs revealed a high degree of variability in ribosome pausing at this site. Finally, we show that the 5’UTR sequence of one Emi1 transcript isoform severely inhibits translation initiation. A likely explanation for this effect is the presence of several upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in this sequence. Surprisingly, a small number of mRNA molecules encoding this 5’UTR do undergo high levels of translation. It is possible that highly translating mRNAs are generated through alternative downstream transcription start site selection, which generates an mRNA that lacks the repressive sequence (for example, the uORFs). Alternatively, translation could occur if the 5’UTR repressive sequence is cleaved off, followed by recapping after transcription, if a repressive protein factor dissociates, or if an inhibitory RNA secondary structure unfolds. Further studieswill be required to distinguish between these possibilities. In summary, here we have developed an imaging method that enables the measurement of ribosome initiation and translocation rates on single mRNA molecules in live cells. Future developments of this technology could include simultaneous observation of single translation factors or other regulatory molecules together with mRNAs and nascent polypeptides, which would provide a very powerful system to dissect the molecular mechanisms of translational control."

Currently, methods for observing the complete process of translation from single mRNAs in vivoare unavailable.

This approach reveals a surprising heterogeneity in the translation of individual mRNAs within the same cell, including rapid and reversible transitions between a translating and non-translating state. Applying this method to the cell cycle gene Emi1, we find strong overall repression of translation initiation byspecific  5’UTR  sequences,  but  individual  mRNA  molecules  in  the  same  cell  can  exhibit dramatically different translational efficiencies. The ability to observe translation of single mRNA molecules in live cells provides a powerful tool to study translationregulation.",
